ML Model,Algorithm,Gradient Descent,"Widely used optimization algorithm in machine learning, particularly for training models like neural networks. Its primary goal is to minimize a loss function, which measures the error between the model's predictions and the actual outcomes, by iteratively adjusting the model’s parameters.

Traditional Gradient Descent vs. Stochastic Gradient Descent
In Batch Gradient Descent, the algorithm computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model’s parameters using the entire dataset before updating the parameters. While this approach provides a precise update direction, it is computationally expensive and slow for large datasets since it requires processing all data points in each iteration.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) addresses this issue by approximating the gradient. Instead of computing gradients over the full dataset, SGD updates the model’s parameters using just a single data point at each step. This significantly reduces computational cost per iteration, making the algorithm much faster. However, since updates are based on a single random sample, they introduce high variance (noise), causing fluctuations that may prevent smooth convergence.
Mini-Batch Gradient Descent: To balance efficiency and stability, a common alternative is Mini-Batch Gradient Descent. Instead of using the full dataset (Batch Gradient Descent) or a single data point (SGD), Mini-Batch Gradient Descent computes updates using a small batch of randomly selected data points (e.g., 32, 64, or 128 samples per batch). This approach: Reduces noise compared to SGD while still being computationally efficient. 
Leverages vectorized operations for faster computation using modern hardware (e.g., GPUs).
Smooths out updates while still allowing some stochasticity to escape local minima.
Benefits & Trade-offs of SGD
Faster updates: Each iteration is computationally cheaper than full-batch gradient descent.
Better exploration: The randomness in updates helps escape local minima.
Higher variance: The noisier updates may lead to less stable convergence, requiring techniques like learning rate decay or momentum to improve performance.
Slower convergence: Since updates are less precise, SGD may take longer to reach the optimal solution.
Conclusion
SGD, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, and Batch Gradient Descent each offer different trade-offs in terms of speed, stability, and computational efficiency. In practice, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent is the most commonly used approach for deep learning, as it provides a balance between computational efficiency and convergence stability.",252,211,1,211

ML Model,Algorithm,SGDClassifier,"SGDClassifier is a linear classification algorithm that trains models using stochastic gradient descent, updating parameters incrementally with each batch or observation. It is important because it scales efficiently to very large datasets and supports multiple loss functions (e.g., logistic regression, hinge loss). SGDClassifier is commonly used when data is high-dimensional, streaming, or too large for batch optimization methods. It trades some stability for speed and scalability.",252,211,1,211

ML Model,Algorithm,StackingClassifier,"StackingClassifier is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple base classifiers by training a higher-level “meta-model” to learn how best to aggregate their predictions. It emerged from ensemble learning research in the 1990s, building on the idea that diverse models capture different patterns in data. Its importance lies in its ability to improve predictive performance beyond any single model by leveraging complementary strengths. Stacking is especially effective when base models are heterogeneous (e.g., trees, linear models, SVMs). It is commonly applied in high-stakes predictive tasks such as fraud detection, credit scoring, and machine-learning competitions.",252,211,1,211

ML Model,Algorithm,Support Vector Machines,"Finds the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes in a feature space. The hyperplane is chosen to maximize the margin, which is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class, known as support vectors. By default, generally a Linear Line, however can utilize Kernels to change, such that datasets where decision boundary is not linearly seperable can become so in higher dimensions.

ModelStrengths: Effective in high-dimensional spaces, works well with clear margins of separation. Model Weaknesses:Computationally expensive, struggles with large datasets.",252,211,1,211
ML Model,Algorithm,Support Vector Regression,"SVR tries to fit a function within a margin of tolerance (epsilon) around the true data points — instead of minimizing the error between predicted and actual values like in ordinary least squares regression. Margin of Tolerance (ε): Instead of minimizing all errors, SVR ignores errors as long as they're within this ""epsilon-tube"" around the true values.Support Vectors: Only data points outside the epsilon margin contribute to the model (i.e., they influence the regression line).Kernel Trick: Like SVM, SVR can use kernels (e.g., linear, RBF) to model nonlinear relationships.",252,211,1,211
ML Model,Algorithm,Support Vector Classifier (SVC),"Supervised machine learning algorithm based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) framework, designed for classification tasks. It originated in the 1990s from statistical learning theory, with foundations laid by Vladimir Vapnik and colleagues. SVC is important because it focuses on finding the optimal decision boundary that maximizes the margin between classes, which often leads to strong generalization performance. Through the use of kernel functions, SVC can model complex, non-linear relationships without explicitly transforming the feature space. It is widely applied in text classification, bioinformatics, image recognition, and high-dimensional problems. Can do Linear, or Non-Linear.",252,211,1,211

ML Model,Algorithm,VotingClassifier,"VotingClassifier is an ensemble method that combines predictions from multiple different models into a single prediction, using either majority voting (hard voting) or averaged probabilities (soft voting). It is important because combining diverse models often improves robustness and generalization compared to any single model. Voting classifiers are typically used when several reasonably strong models exist and their errors are not perfectly correlated. They are especially useful in production systems where stability is valued over interpretability.",252,211,1,211

ML Model,Algorithm,Centroid-based clustering,"Centroid-based clustering groups data points by assigning each point to the nearest representative center (centroid). It answers the question: “What are the main archetypal behavior patterns in the data?” Its strengths are scalability, stability, and interpretability, making it well suited for large datasets and business-facing segmentation. Its main weakness is that it assumes roughly spherical clusters and requires the number of clusters (K) to be chosen in advance.",252,211,1,211
ML Model,Algorithm,Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM),A Gaussian Mixture Model assumes data is generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions and assigns each observation a probability of belonging to each cluster. It is useful for soft segmentation and identifying transitional or ambiguous cases. GMMs are more flexible than KMeans but require careful feature scaling and can be unstable on high-dimensional or noisy data. They are best used when overlap between segments is expected and meaningful.,252,211,1,211
ML Model,Algorithm,Graph-based clustering,"Graph-based clustering represents data as a network where nodes are observations and edges represent similarity, then identifies communities within the graph. It answers the question: “What natural communities emerge from pairwise relationships?” Its strength is capturing complex, non-linear structure that other methods miss. Its weaknesses are scalability challenges and difficulty explaining results to non-technical stakeholders.",252,211,1,211
ML Model,Algorithm,kNN graph clustering,kNN graph clustering builds a graph by connecting each observation to its nearest neighbors and then finds communities within that graph. It is useful for discovering local structure and non-obvious groupings in complex data. Its strength is flexibility and sensitivity to fine-grained patterns. Its weakness is computational cost and dependence on similarity definitions and neighborhood size.,252,211,1,211
ML Model,Algorithm,Hard Voting,"Hard voting is an ensemble decision strategy where multiple classifiers each cast a single class prediction, and the final output is determined by majority vote. It emerged from early ensemble and committee-based learning approaches. Its importance lies in its simplicity and robustness, particularly when individual models make uncorrelated errors. Hard voting is most effective when all models have comparable performance and confidence calibration is not required. It is commonly used in baseline ensemble classifiers and interpretable decision systems.",252,211,1,211
ML Model,Algorithm,Soft Voting,"Soft voting is an ensemble technique where classifiers output class probabilities, which are averaged (or weighted) to determine the final prediction. It evolved as probabilistic classifiers became more common and better calibrated. Soft voting is important because it incorporates confidence information, often leading to better performance than hard voting. It is especially effective when combining diverse models with well-calibrated probability outputs. Soft voting is widely used in production ML systems and competitive modeling.",252,211,1,211
ML Model,Definition,Activation Function,"A mathematical function applied to a neuron’s weighted input that introduces non-linearity into a neural network. This non-linearity enables the model to learn complex, non-linear relationships in the data. Activation functions are applied within layers during the forward pass of a neural network, transforming intermediate representations before passing them to the next layer. Activation choice affects gradient flow, training stability, and convergence speed. Poor choices can cause vanishing or exploding gradients, limiting the depth or effectiveness of the network",252,101,1,5
ML Model,Definition,Loss Function,"A loss function is a mathematical function that measures how far a model’s predictions are from the true target values, producing a single scalar value that represents prediction error and defines the objective to be minimized during training. The loss function is evaluated during training after the forward pass and is the starting point for backpropagation. Its gradients drive parameter updates via the optimizer. Different loss functions encode different assumptions about error, robustness, and business objectives. Choosing an inappropriate loss can lead to models that optimize the wrong behavior, even if training converges successfully.",252,101,1,5
ML Model,Definition,Model,"The model is the mathematical or algorithmic structure used to map input features to predictions.

It is especially critical in high-stakes or regulated domains.",252,13,1,5
ML Model,Pipeline Stage,Problem Definition,"Problem definition clearly states the business or research question the model is intended to solve and translates it into a machine-learning task (e.g., classification, regression, ranking). It includes defining the target variable, success metrics, constraints (latency, interpretability, cost), and assumptions. This step aligns stakeholders on what success looks likebefore any data or modeling begins. A poorly defined problem almost always leads to building the “right model for the wrong problem.”",252,13,1,5
ML Model,Pipeline Stage,Training,"Training is the process of fitting the model to data by optimizing its parameters to minimize a loss function.

Proper training ensures the model captures meaningful signal without overfitting.",252,13,1,5
ML Model,Pipeline Stage,Validation,"Process which evaluates a trained machine-learning model on data that was not used during training to assess how well it generalizes to unseen data.

There is an assumption that this data set is both representative of other data sets,  and possess similiar statistical distributions', You can argue this is not learning, because slight variances can result in materially different responses and output, Term synonymous with machines doing tasks without explicitly being programmed. Building a statistical model, based on a dataset",252,6,1,3
ML Model,Guiding Principle,Optimization,"Optimization is the process of finding the best possible solution to a problem by systematically adjusting inputs or decisions to maximize or minimize a defined objective, subject to given constraints. In machine learning and analytics, optimization involves selecting model parameters that minimize error or maximize performance according to a chosen loss function. Importantly, what is considered “best” depends entirely on how the objective and constraints are defined.",252,6,1,3
ML Model,Guiding Principle,Deep Learning,"Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layer neural networks to automatically learn hierarchical representations from data, reducing the need for manual feature engineering. By stacking simple processing units called layers—each acting as a filter that transforms inputs into higher-level representations—deep learning models can capture complex patterns through composition. Early challenges such as vanishing gradients, where learning signals faded through many layers, were largely addressed through improved activation functions, optimization methods, and weight initialization strategies. In practice, building a deep learning model involves defining the network architecture (number of layers, connections, and activations) and then specifying how it learns by choosing an optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics during compilation.",252,6,1,3
ML Model,Model Type,Reinforcement Learning,"Reinforcement learning trains an agent to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

ML Model,Model Type,Semisupervised Learning,Semi-supervised learning combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data to improve learning performance. The model leverages the structure in the unlabeled data to generalize better than supervised learning alone. This approach is useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.,252,5,1,5

ML Model,Model Type,Assessment,"Assessment refers to techniques that do not learn patterns from data but instead evaluate, diagnose, or measure the behavior, performance, or reliability of models or data. These methods operate on model outputs, predictions, or residuals rather than updating model parameters. Assessment is essential for understanding model quality, robustness, and fitness for purpose, but it does not produce a trained model. This learning type characterizes analytical or evaluative tools rather than learning algorithms.",252,5,1,5
ML Model,Function,AdditiveChi2Sampler,,252,4,1,1
ML Model,Theorem,Curse of Dimensionality,"As dimensionality grows, data points become increasingly sparse, distances lose meaning, and models require exponentially more data to learn reliable patterns. This makes learning, generalization, and computation more difficult, often degrading model performance rather than improving it. In high-dimensional spaces, the optimization landscape also becomes far more complex, with many local minima and saddle points, making it harder to identify or converge toward a meaningful global minimum.",252,4,1,1
ML Model,Model Architecture,Autoregressive,"Autoregressive models generate outputs one step at a time, where each prediction depends on the previously generated outputs. This sequential dependency allows the model to capture context and coherence, making it powerful for tasks like language modeling and time-series forecasting. However, because predictions are made step by step, autoregressive methods can be slower at inference compared to parallel approaches.",252,2,1,1
ML Model,Evaluation,Silhouette Score,"Measures how well each data point fits within its assigned cluster compared to the nearest alternative cluster. It compares the average distance to points in the same cluster (cohesion) against the average distance to points in the closest neighboring cluster (separation). Scores range from −1 to 1, where higher values indicate tighter and more clearly separated clusters. The overall Silhouette Score is the average of these values across all data points and is best used to compare clustering configurations rather than as an absolute measure of quality.

> 0.5: Strong clustering
0.3–0.5: Reasonable structure
< 0.3: Weak separation / noisy clusters",252,1,1,1
Data Preparation,Definition,Momentum,"Momentum represents the direction and rate of change in behavior over time. It answers the question “Is this entity increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable?” and captures transitional dynamics that are not visible from state or baseline alone. Momentum is critical for detecting emerging trends, shifts in behavior, and potential future movement between segments. In modeling, Momentum often explains why change is occurring rather than what the current condition is.",31,101,2,8
Data Preparation,Definition,Baseline,"Baseline represents the typical or expected behavior of an entity over a meaningful historical period. It answers the question “What is normal for this entity?” and provides context against which current state and changes can be interpreted. Baseline is conceptually stable even when its numeric value evolves, allowing models to distinguish structural differences between entities from temporary deviations. In modeling, Baseline is often foundational for defining identity and long-term segmentation.",31,101,1,8
Data Preparation,Definition,Dimension,"A Dimension is a conceptual axis of behavior or meaning that you believe exists in the real world and want your model to represent. It answers a behavioral or semantic question, not a technical one. Dimensions are stable over time, even as data sources, features, or models change (for example, we always need to understand Current State, and rate of change, even though both of what is being studied may change drastically). They are the why behind your features.
Ultimately, it is the question, What Behaviour Matters.",31,101,1,8
Data Preparation,Definition,Implementation,"An Implementation is a specific measurable representation of a dimension, constructed from available data. It answers the question: “How do we observe this dimension in practice?” Implementations can change as data improves, but they should always map clearly back to a single dimension. Examples include; 6-month rolling average balance, 12-month median transaction value, Seasonally adjusted mean.
Ultimately it is the question, How do we measure it.",31,101,1,8
Data Preparation,Definition,Parameter,"A Parameter is a tuning choice that controls how an implementation is calculated, without changing what it represents. Parameters affect sensitivity, smoothness, or scale, but not conceptual meaning. They are the knobs you turn during experimentation. Examples include Window length: 3M vs 6M vs 12M, Weighting scheme: equal vs exponential, Aggregation: mean vs median
Ultimately it is the questions, How do we compute it.",31,101,1,8
Data Preparation,Definition,Volatility,"Volatility represents the consistency or variability of behavior over time. It answers the question “How stable or predictable is this entity’s behavior?” and distinguishes steady patterns from irregular or erratic ones. Volatility provides important diagnostic context, helping differentiate sustained change from noise or one-off events. In modeling, Volatility is typically explanatory or risk-related rather than defining core identity.",31,101,1,8
Data Preparation,Definition,Semantic Type,"Influenced by the literal definition of semantic: the meaning or  nature of a variable, describes what kind of real-world concept a variable represents, independent of any specific model. It classifies data based on meaning—such as whether a variable reflects behaviour (actions over time), structure (relatively stable state or capacity), or context (situational or explanatory attributes). Definition helps to classify the variable for inclusion, or exclusion of a model.",31,101,1,8
Data Preparation,Definition,Functional Role,"Describes how a variable is used within a specific model or modeling process, rather than what it represents conceptually. It classifies variables based on whether they actively shape the model (core), help interpret results (descriptive), or evaluate model quality and stability (diagnostic). For example, POS Transaction 6-Month Average may be a core variable that defines clusters, while Assignment Margin is diagnostic because it evaluates how confidently members are assigned. Classifying functional role is critical in ML modeling—especially in unsupervised learning—because it makes modeling assumptions explicit, prevents unintended variables from shaping outcomes, and enables controlled, explainable model evolution.",31,101,1,8
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Constraint,"Constraint represents limitations or enabling conditions that bound an entity’s range of possible behavior. It answers the question “What limits or enables this entity’s choices?” by approximating capacity, dependency, or stress through proxy measures such as income concentration or balance volatility. Constraint measures help distinguish inability from preference. In modeling, Constraint variables are best used diagnostically to interpret cluster composition rather than to define cluster membership.",31,16,2,16
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,State,"State represents the current condition of an entity at a specific point in time. It answers the question “Where is this entity right now?” and reflects the most recent observed values of relevant measures, frequency, balances, etc. State is essential for anchoring decisions in the present but is insufficient on its own without historical context. In modeling, State provides immediacy and scale but must be interpreted alongside other dimensions to avoid over-reacting to short-term fluctuations. Examples Include: Current Deposit Balance, Current Month POS TXN Count, Number of Active Accounts.",31,16,1,16
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Descriptive,"Descriptive represents summarized or smoothed representations of an entity’s behavior over a defined historical window. It answers the question “What does this entity typically look like?” by reducing short-term noise and highlighting central tendency or typical patterns across time. Descriptive measures provide stability and interpretability by contextualizing current behavior within a broader historical baseline. In modeling, Descriptive variables help prevent over-reaction to transient spikes or dips but must be carefully managed to avoid redundancy with State measures. Examples include Avg Balances, Maximums over an extended period of time.",31,16,1,16
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Diagnostic,"Diagnostic represents measures of directionality, momentum, or variability in an entity’s behavior over time. It answers the question “How is this entity changing?” by capturing growth, decline, volatility, or acceleration relative to prior periods. Diagnostic measures are essential for understanding trajectory, early warning signals, and emerging shifts that may not yet be visible in current state alone. In modeling, Diagnostic variables enhance interpretability and foresight but should be used cautiously, as excessive reliance can introduce instability and reduce cluster persistence. Diagnostic can be broken into 4 Categories, Trend, Momentum, Change and Volatility.",31,16,1,16
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Structural,"Structural represents relatively stable attributes that describe how an entity is configured within the system rather than how it behaves at a given moment. It answers the question “What is the entity’s structural position?” by reflecting enduring characteristics such as product holdings, account composition, or long-term balances. Structural measures anchor and constrain behavior by defining capacity, access, and configuration. In modeling, Structural variables provide important context but should be included sparingly to avoid overwhelming activity-based signals or unintentionally clustering entities by size rather than behavior. Product Count, Product Flags, Tenure.",31,16,1,16
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Contextual,"Contextual represents external or situational factors that influence behavior but are not behaviors themselves. It answers the question “What conditions surround this entity?” by capturing environmental, geographic, policy, or situational elements that shape observed actions. Contextual measures help explain why similar entities may behave differently under different circumstances. In modeling, Contextual variables are generally inappropriate as primary drivers of similarity but are critical for interpretation, validation, and responsible application of results. Examples include, Regional Indicator, Interest Rate Macro Flags, Employement Type)",31,16,1,16
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Demographic,"Demographic represents intrinsic attributes of an entity that change infrequently and describe who the entity is rather than what it does. It answers the question “Who is this entity?” by capturing characteristics such as age, household composition, or other identity-level descriptors. Demographic measures provide essential interpretive context and support equity-aware analysis but do not directly represent behavior. In modeling, Demographic variables are typically excluded from defining similarity to avoid embedding bias or non-actionable distinctions, and are instead used for post-hoc analysis, monitoring, and policy alignment. Examples inlcude, Member Age Band, Language Preferences, Postal Code, Household Parameters, etc.",31,16,1,16
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Constraint: Capacity,"Constraints which represent the fundamental economic or operational limits that bound an entity’s feasible range of actions, regardless of intent or preference. They are critical for distinguishing observed behavior from what is realistically possible, helping avoid misinterpretation of low activity as disinterest rather than limitation. In modeling, capacity constraints provide guardrails for ethical interpretation and prevent over-attribution of agency where structural limits exist. They are best used diagnostically to contextualize clusters and inform suitability, risk, and support decisions.

Examples; Debt service ratio (estimated obligations ÷ inflows), Credit utilization rate, Liquidity coverage ratio (liquid balances ÷ monthly outflows)",31,16,1,16
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Constraint: Stability & Fragility,"Constraints which capture the reliability and predictability of an entity’s financial or behavioral foundation rather than its current level or direction. They are important because volatility, dependency, or irregularity can severely limit planning ability and resilience even when averages appear healthy. These constraints help explain why entities with similar states behave differently under stress or change. In modeling, they support early risk identification and responsible interpretation without driving cluster formation.

Examples; Balance volatility index, Income concentration ratio, Irregular inflow variability score",31,16,1,16
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Constraint: Access & Configuration,"Constraints which reflect limitations imposed by system setup, product availability, or channel enablement rather than by the entity’s choices. They are important because behavior cannot be meaningfully interpreted without understanding what options are actually available. These constraints help distinguish exclusion or friction from deliberate disengagement. In modeling, they ensure clusters are interpreted in light of opportunity sets rather than assumed preferences.

Examples; Lack of revolving credit access flag, Digital banking enablement indicator, Funds locked in restricted or term products ratio",31,16,1,16
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Constraint: Stress & Load,"Constraints which represent sustained pressure that restricts flexibility and increases vulnerability, even if short-term indicators appear stable. They are important for identifying entities operating near or beyond their functional limits, where small shocks can lead to outsized effects. These constraints help explain brittle or reactive behaviors that are not captured by state alone. In modeling, they support responsible application by highlighting latent risk without over-weighting transient fluctuations.

Examples: Frequency of negative net cash-flow periods, Overdraft reliance rate, Minimum balance breach frequency",31,16,1,16
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Constraint: Time & Commitment,"Constraints which capture obligations that reduce an entity’s degrees of freedom over a defined horizon, independent of current behavior. They are important because long-term commitments can materially limit adaptability, even when present conditions seem favorable. These constraints help explain inertia, delayed responses, or resistance to change in observed behavior. In modeling, they provide critical context for interpreting persistence and transition dynamics across clusters. 

Examples. Fixed commitment load (recurring debits ÷ outflows), Long-term product commitment score, Contractual tenure-weighted obligation index",31,16,1,16
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Diagnostic - Change,"Measures the difference in a value between two defined points in time. It answers the question “How much did this metric increase or decrease?” by comparing a current period to a prior baseline. Change captures short-term movement and is often the first signal of emerging behavior. In modeling, Change variables are useful for detecting early shifts but can be noisy if used without context.
Examples: Month-over-month change in total deposits, Change in transaction count compared to last month, Increase or decrease in average account balance since prior period",31,16,1,16
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Diagnostic - Trend,"Describes the overall direction and pattern of change across multiple time periods rather than a single comparison. It answers “Is this behavior generally increasing, decreasing, or stable over time?” by smoothing short-term fluctuations. Trends provide insight into sustained behavioral movement and are more stable than point-in-time changes. In modeling, Trend variables help distinguish temporary spikes from meaningful trajectories.

Examples: 6-month rolling trend in payroll deposits, Slope of average monthly balance over the past year, Directional trend in debit transaction volume",31,16,1,16
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Diagnostic - Volatility,"Measures how variable or inconsistent a metric is over time. It answers “How stable is this behavior?” by capturing dispersion, fluctuation, or unpredictability around a typical value. High volatility often indicates irregular engagement or financial instability, while low volatility suggests consistent behavior. In modeling, Volatility variables can be strong predictors but must be interpreted carefully to avoid overreacting to noise.

Examples: Standard deviation of monthly deposits over 6 months, Variability in transaction counts across recent periods, Fluctuation in balance levels month to month",31,16,1,16
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Diagnostic - Momentum,"Measures the rate and acceleration of change rather than the direction alone. It answers “Is this behavior changing faster or slowing down?” by assessing whether growth or decline is intensifying. Momentum highlights inflection points that may not yet be visible in overall trend. In modeling, Momentum variables are powerful early-warning indicators but can introduce instability if overused. It is effectively the second derivative, so the change of the change.

Examples;  Acceleration in deposit growth over consecutive months, Increasing rate of decline in account balances, Speed of increase in digital transaction adoption",31,16,1,16
Data Preparation,Functional Role,Monitoring,"Variables used to track outcomes, drift, or post-engagement effects over time. Monitoring variables are excluded from clustering inputs to avoid leakage but are essential for evaluating stability and impact.",31,4,2,4
Data Preparation,Functional Role,Core Variables,"Primary drivers of similarity and distance in cluster formation. They directly define the behavioral dimensions the segmentation is intended to capture, and removing them would materially change cluster structure or archetype meaning. Core variables are included in distance calculations and must remain stable across model iterations to preserve interpretability. Core variables are most often State or Descriptive behavioral measures, and should be limited in number.",31,4,1,4
Data Preparation,Functional Role,Supporting,"Contribute to cluster separation, stability, or boundary refinement but do not independently define cluster identity. They may influence distance calculations or be used in secondary weighting, but clusters should remain interpretable without them. Supporting variables help smooth transitions, reduce ambiguity, or capture secondary behavior patterns. Supporting variables can include State, Descriptive, Structural, or Diagnostic measures.",31,4,1,4

Mathematics,Definition,Euclidean distance ,"Straight-line distance between two points in space, calculated as the square root of the sum of squared differences across each dimension. It is important because it provides a natural, intuitive measure of similarity in continuous numeric spaces and underpins many algorithms in geometry, physics, and machine learning (especially distance-based methods like clustering). The concept originates from Euclid, whose Elements (circa 300 BCE) formalized geometry based on distances and angles in flat space. In modern data science, Euclidean distance generalizes this idea to higher dimensions, where each feature represents an axis in space.",25,101,1,17
Mathematics,Definition,Density-based clustering,"Density-based clustering identifies clusters as regions of high point density separated by sparse regions. It answers the question: “Which observations naturally group together, and which ones are unusual or isolated?” Its strengths include the ability to detect arbitrarily shaped clusters and identify outliers as noise. Its weaknesses are sensitivity to hyperparameters and reduced stability on very large or unevenly distributed datasets.",25,101,1,17
Mathematics,Definition,Probabilistic clustering,"Probabilistic clustering models data as coming from overlapping probability distributions rather than assigning hard cluster boundaries. It answers the question: “To what degree does this observation belong to each group?” Its strength is capturing uncertainty and mixed behaviors, which is often more realistic in human or financial data. The weakness is increased complexity, sensitivity to assumptions, and reduced interpretability for non-technical audiences.",25,101,1,17
Mathematics,Definition,Instance Based Learning,"Instance-Based Learning is a learning paradigm where predictions or inferences are made by directly comparing new observations to stored examples rather than learning an explicit global model. It answers the question: “What past observations most closely resemble this one?” Its strengths are simplicity, transparency, and flexibility, as it makes few assumptions about the underlying data structure. Its weaknesses include sensitivity to feature scaling and noise, lack of global summarization, and higher computational cost at inference time for large datasets",25,101,1,17

Mathematics,Definition,Margin of Error,"The margin of error represents the range within which the true population value is expected to lie, given the sample estimate. It is usually expressed as a percentage (e.g., ±5%). It helps determine how precise or reliable the sample estimate is, indicating the level of uncertainty in the results.",25,101,1,17
Mathematics,Definition,Manifold Hypothesis,"The manifold hypothesis suggests that although data lives in a very high-dimensional space, the meaningful structure (e.g., images of digits) lies on a much lower-dimensional surface (the manifold). While digits like ""3"" and ""8"" are visually distinct, they are all constrained by shared generative factors (stroke thickness, slant, etc.), so they occupy nearby regions of this manifold — which is tiny compared to the full space. A manifold is a smooth shape that may curve and twist in space but can be described with a few dimensions. Machine learning models assume that high-dimensional data lies on such a shape, allowing them to learn simpler patterns.",25,101,1,17
Mathematics,Definition,Grapth Theory,"Branch of mathematics focused on the study of graphs, which model relationships using nodes (vertices) and connections (edges) between them. It originated in 1736 with Leonhard Euler’s solution to the Königsberg bridge problem, widely regarded as the first formal result in the field. Graph Theory is important because it provides a powerful and flexible framework for representing and analyzing complex relational structures. It underpins many modern algorithms by enabling reasoning about connectivity, flow, influence, and structure in systems. Applications span computer science and data science (networks, search, recommendation systems), operations research (routing, scheduling), biology (protein and gene interaction networks), and social sciences (social and organizational networks)",25,101,1,17
Mathematics,Definition,Heteroskedasticity,"Condition in which the variance of errors (or residuals) in a model is not constant across observations. The term originates from econometrics, combining the Greek hetero (different) and skedasis (dispersion). It is important because many statistical models—especially linear regression—assume constant variance (homoskedasticity), and violations can lead to inefficient estimates and misleading confidence intervals. In practice, heteroskedasticity commonly appears in financial, economic, and behavioral data where variability grows with scale (e.g., higher income → more variable spending). Addressing it often involves transformations, robust standard errors, or alternative models.",25,101,1,17
Mathematics,Definition,Non-Gaussian,"Data or error distributions that do not follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution. The concept arises from probability theory and statistics, where the Gaussian distribution is often assumed due to its mathematical convenience and the Central Limit Theorem. Its importance lies in the fact that many real-world datasets—such as financial returns, network traffic, or biological signals—exhibit skewness, heavy tails, or multimodality that violate normality assumptions. Non-Gaussian data can significantly affect model performance and inference if not properly handled. In applications, this often motivates the use of robust statistics, nonparametric methods, or models explicitly designed for alternative distributions.",25,101,1,17
Mathematics,Definition,Multicollinearity,"When two or more predictor variables in a model are highly correlated with one another. The term comes from regression analysis and highlights a structural issue rather than a data-quality problem. It is important because multicollinearity inflates variance in coefficient estimates, making them unstable and difficult to interpret, even if overall model performance appears strong. This can obscure the true relationship between predictors and the target variable. In practice, multicollinearity is addressed through feature selection, dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA), or regularization techniques like Ridge regression.",25,101,1,17
Mathematics,Definition,Weighted Bipartite Graph,"Graph structure that represents relationships between two distinct types of entities, where connections exist only across types and not within the same type. In this model, one set of nodes represents individuals and the other represents accounts, and each edge represents an authority or relationship linking a person to an account. The weight assigned to each edge quantifies the relative strength, influence, or significance of that relationship (for example, full signing authority versus limited or advisory roles). This structure enables systematic aggregation and projection of relationships (such as person-to-person connections) while preserving the underlying role-based semantics and relative strength of authority.",25,101,1,17
Mathematics,Theorem,Naive Bayes,"Principle in probability theory that describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. It was first developed by Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century English statistician and theologian, and later formalized and popularized by Pierre-Simon Laplace. The theorem provides a mathematical relationship between prior probability (initial belief), likelihood (evidence), and posterior probability (updated belief). Its importance lies in its ability to support reasoning under uncertainty, making it a core concept in statistics, machine learning, medicine, finance, and decision science. In machine learning, it forms the foundation of the Naive Bayes algorithm, where it is used to estimate class probabilities based on observed features.

Adding Naive Assumption assumes independence, which drastically simplifies the calculation.",25,4,2,3

Mathematics,Theorem,Best Linear Unbiased Estimator,"The Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) is an estimation method in statistics that produces parameter estimates that are linear in the observed data, unbiased, and have the smallest possible variance among all such estimators. It originates from the Gauss–Markov theorem, developed in the early 19th century in the context of least squares and error theory. Its importance lies in providing a theoretical benchmark: under specific assumptions about error structure, no other linear unbiased estimator can be more precise. In practice, BLUE underpins ordinary and generalized least squares, and is widely applied in econometrics, engineering, and data science when modeling relationships with correlated or heteroskedastic errors",25,4,1,3

Behavioural Economics,Definition,Anchoring Effect,"A cognitive bias where people rely too heavily on the first piece of information (the “anchor”) when making decisions. Once an anchor is set, it influences subsequent judgments, even if it’s arbitrary or unrelated. For example, when asked whether the Eiffel Tower is taller or shorter than 500 feet, people’s estimates will cluster around that number. This bias can affect pricing, negotiations, and even forecasting.",20,101,1,20
Behavioural Economics,Definition,Base Rate Fallacy,"People ignore or undervalue general statistical information (the base rate) and focus instead on specific information, often leading to incorrect conclusions. In decision-making, individuals may give more weight to anecdotal or vivid information, despite the broader statistical reality that should influence their judgment. Imagine a test for a rare disease that is 95% accurate. The disease affects 1 in 10,000 people. If a person tests positive, many might assume the likelihood of them having the disease is high. However, considering the base rate (the rarity of the disease), the probability of actually having the disease is still very low. In this scenario, the base rate fallacy would be ignoring the low prevalence of the disease (the base rate) and overestimating the accuracy of the test result, leading to an exaggerated belief in the likelihood of the person having the disease. The fallacy demonstrates how people's intuitive reasoning often neglects the significance of background statistical data in favor of more attention-grabbing or salient information.",20,101,1,20

Behavioural Economics,Definition,Blind spot bias,"Cognitive bias where people are unaware of their own biases, while easily recognizing the biases in others.  People tend to believe they are more objective, rational, and less susceptible to biases than others, even though they may exhibit the same biases in their own thinking. Self-awareness gap: People can easily identify cognitive biases (like confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, or stereotyping) in others, but fail to recognize these biases in themselves. Overconfidence in objectivity: Individuals often overestimate their own ability to reason without bias, which can lead to an inflated sense of confidence in their decisions and beliefs. Resistance to feedback: Blind spot bias can make people resistant to feedback, because they believe that they’re viewing situations or information more objectively than they actually are.",20,101,1,20
Behavioural Economics,Definition,Confirmation Bias,"Also known as Selective Perception. What people see can be strongly shaped by what they believe, using the example of a study which occurred during a especially dirty Princeton Dartmouth Football game. After the game people were asked to comment which team was ""Dirtier"" and results were based on which team individuals had allegiance with.

Tendency to search for, interpret, and remember information in a way that confirms one’s preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. People often ignore or downplay evidence that contradicts their views. This bias can reinforce stereotypes, polarize opinions, and skew data interpretation. It’s especially important to watch for in research, media consumption, and decision-making.",20,101,1,20

Behavioural Economics,Definition,Motivated reasoning,"Cognitive phenomenon where people process information in a biased way to support their existing beliefs, desires, or emotions. Instead of evaluating evidence objectively, individuals interpret information in a way that aligns with their preferred conclusions or outcomes. Directional reasoning: When people want to arrive at a specific conclusion, they give more weight to evidence that supports their desired belief and discount or dismiss evidence that contradicts it. Accuracy reasoning: In contrast, this occurs when individuals are genuinely motivated to arrive at a correct or objective conclusion. They carefully analyze all available evidence regardless of whether it supports their initial belief.

Behavioural Economics,Definition,Naive realism,"Naïve realism is a concept from social psychology and philosophy that describes the human tendency to believe that we see the world objectively, and that other people who disagree must be uninformed, irrational, or biased.  
Naïve realism explains why disagreements can become hostile. We assume others are irrational or malicious instead of recognizing legitimate differences in perspective or interpretation. It makes it harder to understand or appreciate others’ viewpoints, since we believe our view is the only valid one.It contributes to us-vs-them mentalities in politics and culture.

Tooling,Definition,Spark,"A fast and general engine for large scale data processing. Distributes information across nodes to limit strain and bottleneck on individual machine. Runs ontop of a cluster Manager, script like any other script, Spark knows how to distribute . Master Program run code and manages interactions between slave tasks (executors). Can run ontop of a Hadoop Cluster – Yarn. Fault tolerant – allows node to go down without crashing or restarting job. A distributed processing framework written primarily in the Scala programming language. The framework offers different language APIs on top of the core Scala-based framework. Spark maintains MapReduce’s linear scalability and fault tolerance, but extends it in three important ways: First, rather than relying on a rigid map-then-reduce format, its engine can execute a more general directed acyclic graph of operators. This means that in situations where MapReduce must write out intermediate results to the distributed filesystem, Spark can pass them directly to the next step in the pipeline. Second, it complements its computational capability with a rich set of transformations that enable users to express computation more naturally. Out-of-the-box functions are provided for various tasks, including numerical computation, datetime processing, and string manipulation. Third, Spark extends its predecessors with in-memory processing. This means that future steps that want to deal with the same dataset need not recompute it or reload it from disk. Spark is well-suited for highly iterative algorithms as well as ad hoc queries.
Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system designed for fast processing of large-scale data by performing tasks in-memory, which significantly speeds up computation compared to disk-based systems like Hadoop. Spark is particularly known for its lazy evaluation model, where transformations on data (such as map or filter) are not executed immediately but are only computed when an action (like collect or reduce) is triggered. This allows Spark to optimize the execution plan by minimizing the number of data passes and combining transformations. Unlike traditional systems that rely heavily on disk storage, Spark primarily keeps data in memory, leading to faster processing, though it can spill to disk if memory limits are exceeded. This design makes it highly efficient for iterative machine learning algorithms and interactive data analytics.

These vectors are typically produced by machine learning models and capture the semantic meaning or similarity between items, enabling searches based on meaning rather than exact matches. Vector databases became prominent with the rise of deep learning and large language models, which rely on embeddings for tasks like recommendation, semantic search, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Their importance lies in enabling fast similarity searches across millions or billions of vectors, which is essential for modern AI applications. Unlike traditional databases that use exact matches or structured queries (e.g., SQL), vector databases use approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms to find the most similar items based on distance metrics such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.",19,101,1,9

Algorthim Classification,Definition,Decision Strategy,"A Decision Strategy is a method used to determine a final outcome by applying rules or aggregation logic to one or more intermediate model outputs, scores, or signals. It originates from decision theory and ensemble methods, where the focus is on how decisions are made rather than how predictions are generated. Decision strategies are important because they separate prediction from decision-making, allowing the same models to support different operational or business objectives. They operate downstream of models and do not learn feature representations or decision boundaries themselves. Common applications include ensemble voting, thresholding, ranking, arbitration between systems, and policy-driven decision logic.",11,101,2,1

ML Project,Pipeline Stage,Evaluation,"
As a general term, Evaluation has multiple meanings, so care is required to be explicit about its usage. In the context of machine learning, Evaluation has two distinct and valid meanings: one as an Algorithm Classification and one as an ML Pipeline Stage. These uses are related but serve different conceptual purposes.

Pipeline Step: Measures how well the final model performs against defined success metrics on a truly unseen test dataset. Metrics depend on the problem type (e.g., accuracy, AUC, RMSE, precision–recall). This step provides an objective assessment of whether the model meets business or research requirements. Evaluation results often determine whether a model is production-ready.

Algorithm Class: Methods that quantify the performance, quality, or reliability of models or learned structures. These techniques produce metrics, scores, or diagnostic summaries rather than predictions or feature transformations. Evaluation methods support model comparison, validation, and selection but do not directly influence how models are trained or how decisions are made.",8,13,1,8
ML Project,Pipeline Stage,Feature Engineering,"Feature engineering is the process of creating new input variables that better represent the underlying patterns in the data.

This step can materially improve performance and stability without changing the underlying model.",8,13,1,8
Model Evaluation,Feature Selection,Area Under the Curve,"AUC (Area Under the Curve) measures a model’s ability to distinguish between classes by summarizing the performance of the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve. It represents the probability that the model ranks a randomly chosen positive example higher than a randomly chosen negative one. AUC ranges from 0.5 (no better than chance) to 1.0 (perfect separation), with higher values indicating better classification performance.
AUC is primarily a binary classification metric, so when using against a multivariate challenge must determine how to score, OVR, OVO. One Vs Rest, One vs One. Using MNist as an example, OVR evaluates 10 0 vs (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), 1 vs () ... etc, Where OVO measures 45 0 Vs 1, 0 vs 2, etc..",8,8,1,8
Model Evaluation,Feature Selection,Bias,"Bias refers to the systematic error in a model that causes it to consistently deviate from the true value or correct predictions. It occurs when an algorithm makes incorrect assumptions or omissions about the data, leading to errors.
High Bias (Underfitting): The model is too simple and cannot capture patterns. 
Low Bias, High Variance (Overfitting). The model memorizes the data but does not generalize.",8,8,1,8
Model Evaluation,Feature Selection,Bias - Variance Trade Off,"The bias-variance trade-off is a key concept in machine learning that highlights the balance between two sources of error: bias and variance, tuning the relationship between a model's complexity, the accuracy of its predictions, and how well it can make predictions on previously unseen data that were not used to train the model The challenge is to find a model that strikes the right balance between bias and variance, as reducing one typically increases the other. The ultimate goal is to minimize the total error, which is the sum of bias error, variance error, and irreducible noise inherent in the data. Achieving this balance ensures the model generalizes well to new, unseen data, avoiding both underfitting and overfitting. More Data vs More Data Science - Bias vs Variance 
It can often be explained by the Trade-Off (Bias - Data Scientist, Variance - Data), where to invest.

In general, as we increase the number of tunable parameters in a model, it becomes more flexible, and can better fit a training data set. It is said to have lower error, or bias. However, for more flexible models, there will tend to be greater variance to the model fit each time we take a set of samples to create a new training data set. It is said that there is greater variance in the model's estimated parameters.High-variance learning methods may be able to represent their training set well but are at risk of overfitting to noisy or unrepresentative training data. In contrast, algorithms with high bias typically produce simpler models that may fail to capture important regularities (i.e. underfit) in the data.",8,8,1,8
Model Evaluation,Feature Selection,Variance,"Variance refers to errors caused by models that are too sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data, often resulting in overfitting. High-variance models are overly flexible, capturing noise as if it were meaningful patterns. A model with many degrees of freedom (such as a high-degree polynomial model) is likely to have high variance and thus overfit the training data. As an example, if you created a model of How Predicting Housing Prices in 1 Neighbourhood would work and applied it to different neighbourhoods, if your model was simple, it wouldn’t work well anywhere and thus would be Wrong, but consistently-ish wrong. If your model was Good, it would work similarly well every well. If you model was overfit, it would work really well in 1 place, not so well elsewhere.

Model Evaluation,Feature Selection,Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC),"Graphical tool used to evaluate the performance of a binary classifier by plotting the true positive rate against the false positive rate across varying decision thresholds. It originated during World War II in signal detection theory to assess radar system performance. ROC analysis is important because it separates a model’s discriminative ability from any single threshold choice. The curve and its summary statistic, the Area Under the Curve (AUC), provide a threshold-independent measure of performance. ROC is widely used in machine learning, medicine, finance, and risk modeling where trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity matter.",8,8,1,8
Model Evaluation,Feature Selection,F1 Score,"F1 is harmonic mean is a type of average that is calculated by dividing the number of values by the sum of the reciprocals of the values, making it useful for situations where rates or ratios are involved, such as calculating average speeds or in situations where equal weighting is given to each data point’s contribution to the average. The F-score (or F1-score) is a measure of a model’s accuracy that considers both precision and recall. The F1-score is particularly useful when your dataset is imbalanced, and you want to ensure both precision and recall are considered. For example, if you only focus on precision, you might ignore false negatives (missed positive cases), and if you focus only on recall, you could have many false positives. The F1-score provides a balanced assessment by combining both metrics. The F Score is a Harmonic Mean, which means that it gives additional consideration to the effect of Lower Values (1/ sum (1/x)). Using travel time as an example, if you travelled 20 Miles (10 Miles at 30 MPH and 10 Miles at 60 MPH) your harmonic mean would be 36, not 45.",8,8,1,8

This is because everyone understands and feels competent to discuss the bike shed, but few are knowledgeable enough to weigh in on the technical aspects of the power plant. Misallocation of Resources: The law of triviality suggests that important decisions are often overshadowed by trivial ones, leading to a misallocation of attention and resources. Cognitive Bias: People tend to focus on topics they feel more comfortable with, even if those topics are less critical.

The term originates from classical physics, where inertia refers to resistance to change, and was later adopted in statistics and machine learning as an analogy for within-group compactness. In machine learning, inertia is defined as the sum of squared distances between each data point and the centroid of its assigned cluster. It is important because it provides a direct, intuitive measure of cluster compactness and is the objective function minimized during K-means optimization. In practice, inertia is commonly used to evaluate clustering quality and to help select the number of clusters using techniques such as the elbow method.",4,4,1,4

The index combines both intra-cluster dispersion and inter-cluster separation, penalizing solutions where clusters are poorly separated or internally diffuse. It is important because it provides a single scalar value that reflects the trade-off between compactness and separation, two core objectives in clustering. In practice, the Davies–Bouldin Index is widely used to compare clustering solutions and to tune hyperparameters such as the number of clusters.

Clustering,Model Evaluation,Calinski–Harabasz Index,"Also known as the Variance Ratio Criterion, is an internal clustering evaluation metric that assesses cluster quality by comparing between-cluster dispersion to within-cluster dispersion. It was proposed in 1974 by Tadeusz Calinski and Jerzy Harabasz in the context of multivariate statistical analysis. The index is important because it directly reflects how well clusters are separated relative to how compact they are, normalized by the number of clusters and data points. Higher values indicate better-defined clustering structures with dense, well-separated groups. In practice, the Calinski–Harabasz Index is commonly used to select the optimal number of clusters, particularly in K-means and other centroid-based algorithms.

Python,Guiding Principle,Python Function Naming Convention,"Pythonic function naming follows the snake_case convention and uses clear, action-oriented VERBS  to describe exactly what the function does. Function names should be explicit, readable, and predictable, prioritizing clarity over brevity. Functions that return values without side effects commonly use get_, while functions that return booleans should begin with is_, has_, or can_ to make intent unambiguous. This convention improves readability, maintainability, and composability in analytical and production codebases. Examples: 
create, get, transform, calculate, ",2,6,1,2
Python,Guiding Principle,Data Set Column Naming,"Dataset column naming should use ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE and describe what the data represents, not how it was created. Column names should encode semantic meaning, time context, and measurement type so they remain interpretable without reference to code. Unlike functions, column names are noun-driven and stable, serving as part of the dataset’s contract across models, analyses, and stakeholders. Consistent naming supports reproducibility, governance, and correct modeling behavior.

Machine Learning Operations,Definition,MLOps,"(Machine Learning Operations) framework is a structured set of practices, tools, and processes used to develop, deploy, monitor, and maintain machine-learning models in production in a reliable and repeatable way. It extends ideas from DevOps into ML, addressing ML-specific challenges such as data versioning, model drift, reproducibility, and continuous retraining. An MLOps framework defines how models move from experimentation to production, how changes are tracked, and how performance is governed over time. Without MLOps, ML systems tend to break silently, become impossible to reproduce, or drift away from real-world performance.",1,101,1,1
Langchain,Definition,Prompt templates,"Key concept in LangChain. They help translate user input and parameters into instructions for a language model. These templates can be used to guide a model's response, helping it understand the context and generate relevant and coherent language-based outputs.

A prompt template acts as a reusable structure for generating prompts with dynamic values. It allows you to define a consistent format while leaving placeholders for variables that change with each use case. This approach makes prompting more systematic and maintainable, especially when working with complex applications.",1,101,1,1
