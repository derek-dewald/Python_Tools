      "Definition: Constraints which capture the reliability and predictability of an entity’s financial or behavioral foundation rather than its current level or direction. They are important because volatility, dependency, or irregularity can severely limit planning ability and resilience even when averages appear healthy. These constraints help explain why entities with similar states behave differently under stress or change. In modeling, they support early risk identification and responsible interpretation without driving cluster formation.\n",

      "Definition: Models the relationship between an independent variable ( X ) and a dependent variable ( Y ) using a linear function. Model strengths include : Simple, interpretable, computationally efficient, works well for linearly separable data. Weaknesses, Assumes linear relationships, sensitive to outliers. Can calculate using two different approaches, Closed Form or Gradient Decent. Closed Form Solution was the original approach, can be calculated using advanced Calculus, which is easy for simple instances with a low number of independent variables, however Gradient Decent increasingly utilized as easy to implement via numeric calculation,  Python Linear Regression utilizies Pseudoinverse, which is computationally less expensive. However, it is Big O 2² to 2³, which means doubling features increases computations complexity 4 times.\n",

      "Definition: KNeighborsClassifier is a non-parametric classification algorithm that assigns a class based on the majority label among the k nearest data points in feature space. It originates from early pattern recognition and instance-based learning research. Its importance lies in its simplicity and interpretability, requiring no explicit training phase. The model is commonly applied in recommendation systems, pattern recognition, and baseline classification tasks. Its performance depends heavily on distance metrics and feature scaling.\n",
