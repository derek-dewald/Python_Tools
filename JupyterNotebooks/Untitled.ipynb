It represents the probability that the model ranks a randomly chosen positive example higher than a randomly chosen negative one. AUC ranges from 0.5 (no better than chance) to 1.0 (perfect separation), with higher values indicating better classification performance.\n",
      "AUC is primarily a binary classification metric, so when using against a multivariate challenge must determine how to score, OVR, OVO. One Vs Rest, One vs One. Using MNist as an example, OVR evaluates 10 0 vs (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), 1 vs () ... etc, Where OVO measures 45 0 Vs 1, 0 vs 2, etc..\n",
