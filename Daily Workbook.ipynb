    "Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 builds on blob storage and optimizes I/O of high-volume data by using a hierarchical namespace that organizes blob data into directories, and stores metadata about each directory and the files within it. This structure allows operations, such as directory renames and deletes, to be performed in a single atomic operation. Flat namespaces, by contrast, require several operations proportionate to the number of objects in the structure. Hierarchical namespaces keep the data organized, which yields better storage and retrieval performance for an analytical use case and lowers the cost of analysis.\n",

Blob names can include \"/\" characters to organize blobs into virtual \"folders\", but in terms of blob manageability the blobs are stored as a single-level hierarchy in a flat namespace.\n",
