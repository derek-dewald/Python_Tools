Data Preparation,Definition,Baseline,"Baseline represents the typical or expected behavior of an entity over a meaningful historical period. It answers the question “What is normal for this entity?” and provides context against which current state and changes can be interpreted. Baseline is conceptually stable even when its numeric value evolves, allowing models to distinguish structural differences between entities from temporary deviations. In modeling, Baseline is often foundational for defining identity and long-term segmentation.",,,,,,,,,
Data Preparation,Definition,Dimension,"A Dimension is a conceptual axis of behavior or meaning that you believe exists in the real world and want your model to represent. It answers a behavioral or semantic question, not a technical one. Dimensions are stable over time, even as data sources, features, or models change (for example, we always need to understand Current State, and rate of change, even though both of what is being studied may change drastically). They are the why behind your features.
Ultimately, it is the question, What Behaviour Matters.",,,,,,,,,
Data Preparation,Definition,Implementation,"An Implementation is a specific measurable representation of a dimension, constructed from available data. It answers the question: “How do we observe this dimension in practice?” Implementations can change as data improves, but they should always map clearly back to a single dimension. Examples include; 6-month rolling average balance, 12-month median transaction value, Seasonally adjusted mean.
Ultimately it is the question, How do we measure it.",,,,,,,,,
Data Preparation,Definition,Momentum,"Momentum represents the direction and rate of change in behavior over time. It answers the question “Is this entity increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable?” and captures transitional dynamics that are not visible from state or baseline alone. Momentum is critical for detecting emerging trends, shifts in behavior, and potential future movement between segments. In modeling, Momentum often explains why change is occurring rather than what the current condition is.",,,,,,,,,
Data Preparation,Definition,Parameter,"A Parameter is a tuning choice that controls how an implementation is calculated, without changing what it represents. Parameters affect sensitivity, smoothness, or scale, but not conceptual meaning. They are the knobs you turn during experimentation.

Ultimately it is the questions, How do we compute it.",,,,,,,,,
Data Preparation,Definition,State,"State represents the current condition of an entity at a specific point in time. It answers the question “Where is this entity right now?” and reflects the most recent observed values of relevant measures. State is essential for anchoring decisions in the present but is insufficient on its own without historical context. In modeling, State provides immediacy and scale but must be interpreted alongside other dimensions to avoid over-reacting to short-term fluctuations.",,,,,,,,,
Data Preparation,Definition,Volatility,"Volatility represents the consistency or variability of behavior over time. It answers the question “How stable or predictable is this entity’s behavior?” and distinguishes steady patterns from irregular or erratic ones.

Model Evaluation,Feature Selection,Bias - Variance Trade Off,"The bias-variance trade-off is a key concept in machine learning that highlights the balance between two sources of error: bias and variance, tuning the relationship between a model's complexity, the accuracy of its predictions, and how well it can make predictions on previously unseen data that were not used to train the model The challenge is to find a model that strikes the right balance between bias and variance, as reducing one typically increases the other. The ultimate goal is to minimize the total error, which is the sum of bias error, variance error, and irreducible noise inherent in the data. Achieving this balance ensures the model generalizes well to new, unseen data, avoiding both underfitting and overfitting. More Data vs More Data Science - Bias vs Variance 
It can often be explained by the Trade-Off (Bias - Data Scientist, Variance - Data), where to invest.

In general, as we increase the number of tunable parameters in a model, it becomes more flexible, and can better fit a training data set. It is said to have lower error, or bias. However, for more flexible models, there will tend to be greater variance to the model fit each time we take a set of samples to create a new training data set. It is said that there is greater variance in the model's estimated parameters.High-variance learning methods may be able to represent their training set well but are at risk of overfitting to noisy or unrepresentative training data. In contrast, algorithms with high bias typically produce simpler models that may fail to capture important regularities (i.e. underfit) in the data.",,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derek-dewald/d_functions/main/images/bias.png,,,,,,
Model Evaluation,Feature Selection,Variance,"Variance refers to errors caused by models that are too sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data, often resulting in overfitting. High-variance models are overly flexible, capturing noise as if it were meaningful patterns. A model with many degrees of freedom (such as a high-degree polynomial model) is likely to have high variance and thus overfit the training data. As an example, if you created a model of How Predicting Housing Prices in 1 Neighbourhood would work and applied it to different neighbourhoods, if your model was simple, it wouldn’t work well anywhere and thus would be Wrong, but consistently-ish wrong. If your model was Good, it would work similarly well every well. If you model was overfit, it would work really well in 1 place, not so well elsewhere.

ML Model,Algorithm,Gradient Descent,"Widely used optimization algorithm in machine learning, particularly for training models like neural networks. Its primary goal is to minimize a loss function, which measures the error between the model's predictions and the actual outcomes, by iteratively adjusting the model’s parameters.

Traditional Gradient Descent vs. Stochastic Gradient Descent
In Batch Gradient Descent, the algorithm computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model’s parameters using the entire dataset before updating the parameters. While this approach provides a precise update direction, it is computationally expensive and slow for large datasets since it requires processing all data points in each iteration.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) addresses this issue by approximating the gradient. Instead of computing gradients over the full dataset, SGD updates the model’s parameters using just a single data point at each step. This significantly reduces computational cost per iteration, making the algorithm much faster. However, since updates are based on a single random sample, they introduce high variance (noise), causing fluctuations that may prevent smooth convergence.
Mini-Batch Gradient Descent: To balance efficiency and stability, a common alternative is Mini-Batch Gradient Descent. Instead of using the full dataset (Batch Gradient Descent) or a single data point (SGD), Mini-Batch Gradient Descent computes updates using a small batch of randomly selected data points (e.g., 32, 64, or 128 samples per batch). This approach: Reduces noise compared to SGD while still being computationally efficient. 
Leverages vectorized operations for faster computation using modern hardware (e.g., GPUs).
Smooths out updates while still allowing some stochasticity to escape local minima.
Benefits & Trade-offs of SGD
Faster updates: Each iteration is computationally cheaper than full-batch gradient descent.
Better exploration: The randomness in updates helps escape local minima.
Higher variance: The noisier updates may lead to less stable convergence, requiring techniques like learning rate decay or momentum to improve performance.
Slower convergence: Since updates are less precise, SGD may take longer to reach the optimal solution.
Conclusion
SGD, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, and Batch Gradient Descent each offer different trade-offs in terms of speed, stability, and computational efficiency. In practice, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent is the most commonly used approach for deep learning, as it provides a balance between computational efficiency and convergence stability.",,,,"$$

ML Model,Algorithm,Linear Regression,"Models the relationship between an independent variable ( X ) and a dependent variable ( Y ) using a linear function.

However, it is Big O 2² to 2³, which means doubling features increases computations complexity 4 times.

Cost function for Linear Regression is usually Mean Squared Error. While it does not have to be, it is convenient for a number of reasons. 
1) Rarely Overfits, which Polynomial equations frequently do. 
2) It always has a derivative, which makes it convenient for using closed forms solutions (saving computation complexity). Historically was applied via Closed Form Solution, which can be difficult to calculate, computationally expensive. ",,,,"$$

MSE = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2

A linear model can be written as:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X} \boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}

where:
- $( \mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1})$ is the vector of observed values

- $( \boldsymbol{\beta} \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times 1} )$ is the vector of coefficients,
- $( \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1} )$ is the error term.

The closed-form solution for the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate of \( \boldsymbol{\beta} \) is:

$$
\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{y}
$$

provided that $( \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X} )$ is invertible.

This formula is derived by minimizing the sum of squared errors:

$$
\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\beta}) = \|\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X} \boldsymbol{\beta} \|^2
$$

Taking the derivative with respect to $( \boldsymbol{\beta} )$ and setting it to zero:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \boldsymbol{\beta}} = -2 \mathbf{X}^T (\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X} \boldsymbol{\beta}) = 0

Solving for $( \boldsymbol{\beta} )$ gives the closed-form solution above.

Logistic Regression is used for **binary classification**. It predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class.

### **Equation:**
Logistic regression applies the **sigmoid function** to a linear model:

- Otherwise, predict class **0**.

Behavioural Economics,Definition,Anchoring Effect,"A cognitive bias where people rely too heavily on the first piece of information (the “anchor”) when making decisions. Once an anchor is set, it influences subsequent judgments, even if it’s arbitrary or unrelated. For example, when asked whether the Eiffel Tower is taller or shorter than 500 feet, people’s estimates will cluster around that number. This bias can affect pricing, negotiations, and even forecasting.",,,,,,,,,
Behavioural Economics,Definition,Base Rate Fallacy,"People ignore or undervalue general statistical information (the base rate) and focus instead on specific information, often leading to incorrect conclusions. In decision-making, individuals may give more weight to anecdotal or vivid information, despite the broader statistical reality that should influence their judgment. Imagine a test for a rare disease that is 95% accurate. The disease affects 1 in 10,000 people. If a person tests positive, many might assume the likelihood of them having the disease is high. However, considering the base rate (the rarity of the disease), the probability of actually having the disease is still very low. In this scenario, the base rate fallacy would be ignoring the low prevalence of the disease (the base rate) and overestimating the accuracy of the test result, leading to an exaggerated belief in the likelihood of the person having the disease. The fallacy demonstrates how people's intuitive reasoning often neglects the significance of background statistical data in favor of more attention-grabbing or salient information.",,,,,,,,,

Self-awareness gap: People can easily identify cognitive biases (like confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, or stereotyping) in others, but fail to recognize these biases in themselves. Overconfidence in objectivity: Individuals often overestimate their own ability to reason without bias, which can lead to an inflated sense of confidence in their decisions and beliefs. Resistance to feedback: Blind spot bias can make people resistant to feedback, because they believe that they’re viewing situations or information more objectively than they actually are.",,,,,,,,,

Tendency to search for, interpret, and remember information in a way that confirms one’s preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. People often ignore or downplay evidence that contradicts their views. This bias can reinforce stereotypes, polarize opinions, and skew data interpretation. It’s especially important to watch for in research, media consumption, and decision-making.",,,,,,,,,

Accuracy reasoning: In contrast, this occurs when individuals are genuinely motivated to arrive at a correct or objective conclusion. They carefully analyze all available evidence regardless of whether it supports their initial belief.

Mathematics,Definition,Manifold Hypothesis,"The manifold hypothesis suggests that although data lives in a very high-dimensional space, the meaningful structure (e.g., images of digits) lies on a much lower-dimensional surface (the manifold). While digits like ""3"" and ""8"" are visually distinct, they are all constrained by shared generative factors (stroke thickness, slant, etc.), so they occupy nearby regions of this manifold — which is tiny compared to the full space. A manifold is a smooth shape that may curve and twist in space but can be described with a few dimensions. Machine learning models assume that high-dimensional data lies on such a shape, allowing them to learn simpler patterns.","Manifold is different than linear interpolation, manifold is a slow gradual change, linear is averaging/combining.",,,,,,,,

Tooling,Definition,Spark,"A fast and general engine for large scale data processing. Distributes information across nodes to limit strain and bottleneck on individual machine. Runs ontop of a cluster Manager, script like any other script, Spark knows how to distribute . Master Program run code and manages interactions between slave tasks (executors). Can run ontop of a Hadoop Cluster – Yarn. Fault tolerant – allows node to go down without crashing or restarting job. A distributed processing framework written primarily in the Scala programming language. The framework offers different language APIs on top of the core Scala-based framework. Spark maintains MapReduce’s linear scalability and fault tolerance, but extends it in three important ways: First, rather than relying on a rigid map-then-reduce format, its engine can execute a more general directed acyclic graph of operators. This means that in situations where MapReduce must write out intermediate results to the distributed filesystem, Spark can pass them directly to the next step in the pipeline. Second, it complements its computational capability with a rich set of transformations that enable users to express computation more naturally. Out-of-the-box functions are provided for various tasks, including numerical computation, datetime processing, and string manipulation. Third, Spark extends its predecessors with in-memory processing. This means that future steps that want to deal with the same dataset need not recompute it or reload it from disk. Spark is well-suited for highly iterative algorithms as well as ad hoc queries.
Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system designed for fast processing of large-scale data by performing tasks in-memory, which significantly speeds up computation compared to disk-based systems like Hadoop. Spark is particularly known for its lazy evaluation model, where transformations on data (such as map or filter) are not executed immediately but are only computed when an action (like collect or reduce) is triggered. This allows Spark to optimize the execution plan by minimizing the number of data passes and combining transformations. Unlike traditional systems that rely heavily on disk storage, Spark primarily keeps data in memory, leading to faster processing, though it can spill to disk if memory limits are exceeded. This design makes it highly efficient for iterative machine learning algorithms and interactive data analytics.

Theorem,Definition,Parkinson's law of triviality,"When a group is asked to make decisions, they often spend the most time on the simplest, least important aspects because these are easier to understand and discuss. For example, in a meeting to approve the budget for a nuclear power plant, more time might be spent discussing the design of a bike shed for employees than on the complex technicalities of the plant itself. This is because everyone understands and feels competent to discuss the bike shed, but few are knowledgeable enough to weigh in on the technical aspects of the power plant. Misallocation of Resources: The law of triviality suggests that important decisions are often overshadowed by trivial ones, leading to a misallocation of attention and resources. Cognitive Bias: People tend to focus on topics they feel more comfortable with, even if those topics are less critical. This can result in ineffective decision-making where the more significant and complex issues are neglected.",,,,,,,,,

Tooling,Paradigm,Distributed Computing,"A simple way to think about distributed systems is that they are a group of independent computers that appear to the end user as a single computer. They allow for horizontal scaling. That means adding more computers rather than upgrading a single system (vertical scaling). The latter is relatively expensive and often insufficient for large workloads. Distributed systems are great for scaling and reliability but also introduce complexity when it comes to design, construction, and debugging.
