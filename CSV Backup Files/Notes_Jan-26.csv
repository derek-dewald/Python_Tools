The appropriate model type is selected based on the problem context, data availability and quality, time constraints, business objectives, and resource limitations."

Behavioural Economics,Consideration,What does a metric actually represent?,"In February 2018, there were fourteen murders in New York City, but fifteen in London.[1] But what should we conclude? Nothing. We should conclude nothing because that pair of numbers alone tells us very little. If we want to understand what’s happening, we need to step back and take in a broader perspective. Here are a few facts worth knowing about murders in London and New York. London had 184 murders in 1990, while New York suffered 2,262—more than ten times as many. It’s with that image in mind of New York as a murderous place that Londoners are alarmed at the idea that they might have become as rotten as the Big Apple. But London’s murder rate has fallen, not risen, since 1990. In 2017, there were 130 murders in London, including ten people killed in terrorist attacks. London was safe in 1990 and it’s a little bit safer today. As for New York, murders fell to 292 in 2017. That means New York is still more dangerous than London, but much, much safer than in 1990."
Behavioural Economics,Consideration,How to Efficiently Guestimate,"""The population of the United States is 325 million. The population of the United Kingdom is 65 million. The population of the world is 7.5 billion. Name any particular age (under the age of sixty). There are about 800,000 people of that age in the UK. If a policy involves all three-year-olds, for example, there are 800,000 of them. In the United States, there are about 4 million people of any particular age (under the age of sixty). Distance around the Earth: 40,000 kilometers, or 25,000 miles. It varies depending on whether you go around the poles or around the equator, but not much. The drive from Boston to Seattle: 3,000 miles.

Length of a bed: 2 meters (or 7 feet). As Elliott points out, this helps you visualize the size of a room: How many beds is that? The gross domestic product of the United States: about $20 trillion (or $20,000 billion). It’s a lot of walls, if that’s really how you want to spend it. 100,000 words: the length of a medium-size novel. 1,454 feet: the height of the Empire State Building to its tip. (It’s also about 102 stories.)"""
