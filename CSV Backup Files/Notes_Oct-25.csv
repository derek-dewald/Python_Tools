Machine Learning,Lesson Learnt,Always Have a Simple Baseline,"Need a reference to test performance of the model. If dataset is imbalanced, have simple guess. If temperature, guess trailing average, etc, find something simple, often very difficutl to beat, and juice might not be worth the squeeze."
Machine Learning,Downside,Simplicity Not Assumed,"ML can't look naively for a simple common sense solution. Unless feature engineered or hard coded, model will always just plug forward. "
Model Types,Convolutional Neural Networds,General Description,"Convolutional Neural Networks, or CNNs, are a type of machine learning model designed to automatically detect meaningful patterns in data by applying filters that scan across the input. While they are most commonly associated with image processing, CNNs can also be applied effectively to structured data with spatial or temporal patterns, such as time series. In time series data, CNNs act like pattern detectors that can identify trends, spikes, or repeated behaviors over short intervals of time. These models use one-dimensional convolutions, which apply filters along the time axis, allowing the model to capture localized patterns regardless of where they occur in the sequence.

For classification tasks, a CNN can learn to recognize short-term patterns in the time series that are associated with specific labels, such as detecting equipment faults or classifying sensor behavior. For regression tasks, CNNs can extract features from recent data windows and use those to predict future values, like forecasting temperature, stock prices, or energy usage. CNNs are often preferred over recurrent models (like LSTMs) when the relationships in the data are more local or when training speed is important, as they tend to be faster and require fewer parameters.

In summary, convolutional models are a flexible and efficient tool for analyzing time-based data. They are particularly useful when you want to detect local patterns in a sequence and use those to classify or predict outcomes, even in non-image domains."
Model Types,Neural Networks,As Features,"When a CNN processes input (like a time series), it transforms the raw data into higher-level feature representations through its convolutional layers. These representations capture meaningful patterns — like trends, spikes, or periodicities — that are often more informative than the raw data itself.

You can extract these intermediate outputs and use them as features for other models"
Model Types,Neural Networks,Translation invariance,"Translation invariance means that a model, like a CNN, can recognize a pattern regardless of where it appears in the input—for example, detecting a spike in a time series whether it occurs early or late in the sequence"
Model Types,Neural Networks,Max Pooling,"A max pooling layer in machine learning reduces the size of the input by sliding a window over it and keeping only the maximum value in each window, which helps the model focus on the most important features while reducing computation and increasing robustness to small shifts or noise."
Model Types,Neural Networks,Long Short Term Memory,"An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a special kind of neural network used for sequential data, like time series or text, that can learn and remember long-term patterns by using a memory cell and gates that control the flow of information—this allows it to keep important information from earlier in the sequence and forget what’s not relevant, making it well-suited for tasks like prediction, translation, or anomaly detection over time.

Traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) struggle to retain information over long sequences—they remember the recent (short-term) past but tend to ""forget"" earlier (long-term) information. LSTMs were designed to fix this by introducing a memory cell that can store information over long durations, while also using gates to manage short-term updates"
Model Types,Neural Networks,Feedforward,"Feedforward refers to a type of neural network where information moves in one direction only—from the input layer, through any hidden layers, to the output layer—without any loops or feedback connections. Each layer passes its output to the next, and the model does not retain memory of previous inputs, making it well-suited for tasks like classification or regression on fixed-size data."
Model Types,Neural Networks,Vanishing Gradient,"The vanishing gradient problem occurs during the training of deep neural networks when gradients used to update the model’s weights become very small as they are backpropagated through many layers. This causes earlier layers to learn very slowly or not at all, because their weights are barely updated, making it difficult for the model to capture long-range dependencies—especially in deep networks and recurrent architectures like RNNs."
Model Types,Neural Networks,Recurrent Dropout,"Recurrent dropout is a form of dropout applied within the recurrent connections of RNNs or LSTMs, where the same dropout mask is used at each time step to prevent overfitting without disrupting the sequence memory.

In regular dropout, random neurons are ""dropped"" independently at each time step, which can break the model’s ability to learn time-based patterns. Recurrent dropout fixes this by applying the same mask consistently across time, helping the model remain stable while still benefiting from regularization.

This technique is especially useful for LSTM and GRU networks working on small or noisy sequential datasets."

Experimentation,Hypothesis Testing,Design,HARK is an acronym for Hypothesizing After Results Known.
Experimentation,Hypothesis Testing,Design,"Standard statistical tests assume that the researcher made the choice before collecting the data, then collected data, then ran the test. If the researcher ran several tests, then made a choice, flukes are vastly more likely."
Experimentation,Hypothesis Testing,Design,"For obvious reasons, this particular flavor of survivorship bias is called “publication bias.” Interesting findings are published; non-findings, or failures to replicate previous findings, face a higher publication hurdle."
Experimentation,Hypothesis Testing,Design,"Out of all the possible studies that could have been conducted, it’s reasonable to guess that the journal was interested only in the ones that demonstrated precognition."
Experimentation,Design Principles,Lessons Learnt,"Sample error reflects the risk that, purely by chance, a randomly chosen sample of opinions does not reflect the true views of the population. The “margin of error” reported in opinion polls reflects this risk, and the larger the sample, the smaller the margin of error. A thousand interviews is a large enough sample for many purposes, and during the 1936 election campaign Mr. Gallup is reported to have conducted three thousand interviews."
Experimentation,Design Principles,Lessons Learnt,Sampling error is when a randomly chosen sample doesn’t reflect the underlying population purely by chance; sampling bias is when the sample isn’t randomly chosen at all. George Gallup took pains to find an unbiased sample because he knew that was far more important than finding a big one.
Experimentation,Design Principles,Lessons Learnt,"Kate Crawford, a researcher at Microsoft, has assembled many examples of when N = All assumptions have led people astray. When Hurricane Sandy hit the New York City area in 2012, researchers published an analysis of data from Twitter and a location-based search engine, Foursquare, showing that they could track a spike in grocery shopping the day before and a boom for bars and nightclubs the day after. That’s fine, as far as it goes—but those tweets about the hurricane were disproportionately from Manhattan, whereas areas such as Coney Island had been hit much harder. In fact, Coney Island had been hit so hard the electricity was out—that was why nobody there was tweeting—while densely populated and prosperous Manhattan was unusually saturated with smartphones, at least by 2012 standards, when they were less ubiquitous than today. To"
Experimentation,Design Principles,Lessons Learnt,"who respond to Literary Digest surveys” differ in some consistent way from “people who vote in elections.” Google Flu Trends captured every Google search, but not everybody who gets the flu turns to Google. Its accuracy depended on “people with flu who consult Google about it” not being systematically different from “people with flu.”"
Experimentation,Design Principles,Lessons Learnt,"Just like people, algorithms are neither trustworthy nor untrustworthy as a general class. Just as with people, rather than asking, “Should we trust algorithms?” we should ask, “Which algorithms can we trust, and what can we trust them to do?”

Visualizations,Visualizations,How people Interpret,"Christ at Emmaus - Feelings can trump expertise. We find ways to dismiss evidence we don’t like, when it supports our preconceptions we are less likely to look for flaws."
Visualizations,Visualizations,What Am I looking at.,The bigger display with a wider array of jams attracted more customers but very few of them actually bought jam. The display that offered fewer choices inspired more sales.[1] The counterintuitive result went viral—it hit a sweet spot. People respond better to fewer choices!
Visualizations,Visualizations,,"Has the performance of the algorithm been assessed rigorously—for example, by running a randomized trial to see if people make better decisions with or without algorithmic advice? Have independent experts been given a chance to evaluate the algorithm? What have they concluded? We should not simply trust that algorithms are doing a better job than humans, nor should we assume that if the algorithms are flawed, the humans would be flawless."
Visualizations,Visualizations,,When someone tells a joke poorly it is more likely than not that they have forgotten to convey an important piece of information in the set up that makes the punch line funny. So it seems the joke is in the set up and not the punch line.

The F-score (or F1-score) is a measure of a model’s accuracy that considers both precision and recall. The F1-score is particularly useful when your dataset is imbalanced, and you want to ensure both precision and recall are considered. For example, if you only focus on precision, you might ignore false negatives (missed positive cases), and if you focus only on recall, you could have many false positives. The F1-score provides a balanced assessment by combining both metrics. The F Score is a Harmonic Mean, which means that it gives additional consideration to the effect of Lower Values (1/ sum (1/x)). Using travel time as an example, if you travelled 20 Miles (10 Miles at 30 MPH and 10 Miles at 60 MPH) your harmonic mean would be 36, not 45."

Confusion Matrix,Evaluation,Precision/Recall Trade-off,"The precision–recall trade-off arises when adjusting a classifier’s decision threshold. If you lower the threshold, the model flags more positives, which increases recall but risks misclassifying more negatives as positives, reducing precision. If you raise the threshold, the model becomes stricter, so precision improves but recall drops because more true positives are missed. In essence, you can’t usually maximize both at once, so the right balance depends on whether false positives or false negatives are more costly in your context."

Confusion Matrix,Evaluation,ROC Curve,"plot that shows how well a binary classifier distinguishes between classes at different decision thresholds. On the x-axis you have the false positive rate (FPR), and on the y-axis the true positive rate (TPR, or recall). By sweeping the threshold from 0 to 1, the curve traces out the trade-off between catching positives and accidentally flagging negatives."
Confusion Matrix,Evaluation,AUC Curve,"AUC (Area Under the Curve) measures a model’s ability to distinguish between classes by summarizing the performance of the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve. It represents the probability that the model ranks a randomly chosen positive example higher than a randomly chosen negative one. AUC ranges from 0.5 (no better than chance) to 1.0 (perfect separation), with higher values indicating better classification performance.
AUC is primarily a binary classification metric, so when using against a multivariate challenge must determine how to score, OVR, OVO. One Vs Rest, One vs One. Using MNist as an example, OVR evaluates 10 0 vs (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), 1 vs () ... etc, Where OVO measures 45 0 Vs 1, 0 vs 2, etc.."
Confusion Matrix,Evaluation,ROC vs Precision Recall Curve,"ROC: “Out of all the negatives, how many did I mess up?” → can hide problems when negatives vastly outnumber positives.
PR: “Out of the people I said were positive, how often was I right?” → directly answers the question when positives are rare."
