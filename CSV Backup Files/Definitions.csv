Machine Learning,Definition,Data Preparation,"Data preparation focuses on cleaning and structuring raw data into a usable format for modeling. This includes handling missing values, correcting errors, standardizing formats, encoding categorical variables, and aligning labels with features. It also often involves train/validation/test splitting to prevent data leakage. This step is critical because most models assume clean, well-structured inputs and are highly sensitive to data issues.",,,,,,,
Machine Learning,Definition,Deployment,"Deployment is the process of integrating the trained model into a production environment where it can generate real-world predictions.

Machine Learning,Definition,Area Under the Curve,"AUC (Area Under the Curve) measures a model’s ability to distinguish between classes by summarizing the performance of the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve. It represents the probability that the model ranks a randomly chosen positive example higher than a randomly chosen negative one. AUC ranges from 0.5 (no better than chance) to 1.0 (perfect separation), with higher values indicating better classification performance.
AUC is primarily a binary classification metric, so when using against a multivariate challenge must determine how to score, OVR, OVO. One Vs Rest, One vs One. Using MNist as an example, OVR evaluates 10 0 vs (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), 1 vs () ... etc, Where OVO measures 45 0 Vs 1, 0 vs 2, etc..",,,,,,,

Machine Learning,Definition,Bias - Variance Trade Off,"The bias-variance trade-off is a key concept in machine learning that highlights the balance between two sources of error: bias and variance, tuning the relationship between a model's complexity, the accuracy of its predictions, and how well it can make predictions on previously unseen data that were not used to train the model The challenge is to find a model that strikes the right balance between bias and variance, as reducing one typically increases the other. The ultimate goal is to minimize the total error, which is the sum of bias error, variance error, and irreducible noise inherent in the data. Achieving this balance ensures the model generalizes well to new, unseen data, avoiding both underfitting and overfitting. More Data vs More Data Science - Bias vs Variance 
It can often be explained by the Trade-Off (Bias - Data Scientist, Variance - Data), where to invest.

In general, as we increase the number of tunable parameters in a model, it becomes more flexible, and can better fit a training data set. It is said to have lower error, or bias. However, for more flexible models, there will tend to be greater variance to the model fit each time we take a set of samples to create a new training data set. It is said that there is greater variance in the model's estimated parameters.High-variance learning methods may be able to represent their training set well but are at risk of overfitting to noisy or unrepresentative training data. In contrast, algorithms with high bias typically produce simpler models that may fail to capture important regularities (i.e. underfit) in the data.",,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derek-dewald/d_functions/main/images/bias.png,,,,
Machine Learning,Definition,Cross Validation,"Model evaluation technique used to assess how well a model generalizes to unseen data by repeatedly splitting the dataset into training and validation subsets.

This approach helps detect overfitting and supports more robust model selection",,,,,,,
Machine Learning,Definition,Curse of Dimensionality,"As dimensionality grows, data points become increasingly sparse, distances lose meaning, and models require exponentially more data to learn reliable patterns. This makes learning, generalization, and computation more difficult, often degrading model performance rather than improving it. In high-dimensional spaces, the optimization landscape also becomes far more complex, with many local minima and saddle points, making it harder to identify or converge toward a meaningful global minimum.",,,,,,,
Machine Learning,Definition,Deep Learning,"Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layer neural networks to automatically learn hierarchical representations from data, reducing the need for manual feature engineering. By stacking simple processing units called layers—each acting as a filter that transforms inputs into higher-level representations—deep learning models can capture complex patterns through composition. Early challenges such as vanishing gradients, where learning signals faded through many layers, were largely addressed through improved activation functions, optimization methods, and weight initialization strategies. In practice, building a deep learning model involves defining the network architecture (number of layers, connections, and activations) and then specifying how it learns by choosing an optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics during compilation.",,,,,,,

The model groups, compresses, or summarizes the data without being told what the correct outcome is. Typical use cases include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.",,,,,,,
Machine Learning,Definition,Variance,"Variance refers to errors caused by models that are too sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data, often resulting in overfitting. High-variance models are overly flexible, capturing noise as if it were meaningful patterns. A model with many degrees of freedom (such as a high-degree polynomial model) is likely to have high variance and thus overfit the training data. As an example, if you created a model of How Predicting Housing Prices in 1 Neighbourhood would work and applied it to different neighbourhoods, if your model was simple, it wouldn’t work well anywhere and thus would be Wrong, but consistently-ish wrong. If your model was Good, it would work similarly well every well. If you model was overfit, it would work really well in 1 place, not so well elsewhere.

Model,Algorithm,Gradient Descent,"Widely used optimization algorithm in machine learning, particularly for training models like neural networks. Its primary goal is to minimize a loss function, which measures the error between the model's predictions and the actual outcomes, by iteratively adjusting the model’s parameters.

Traditional Gradient Descent vs. Stochastic Gradient Descent
In Batch Gradient Descent, the algorithm computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model’s parameters using the entire dataset before updating the parameters. While this approach provides a precise update direction, it is computationally expensive and slow for large datasets since it requires processing all data points in each iteration.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) addresses this issue by approximating the gradient. Instead of computing gradients over the full dataset, SGD updates the model’s parameters using just a single data point at each step. This significantly reduces computational cost per iteration, making the algorithm much faster. However, since updates are based on a single random sample, they introduce high variance (noise), causing fluctuations that may prevent smooth convergence.
Mini-Batch Gradient Descent: To balance efficiency and stability, a common alternative is Mini-Batch Gradient Descent. Instead of using the full dataset (Batch Gradient Descent) or a single data point (SGD), Mini-Batch Gradient Descent computes updates using a small batch of randomly selected data points (e.g., 32, 64, or 128 samples per batch). This approach: Reduces noise compared to SGD while still being computationally efficient. 
Leverages vectorized operations for faster computation using modern hardware (e.g., GPUs).
Smooths out updates while still allowing some stochasticity to escape local minima.
Benefits & Trade-offs of SGD
Faster updates: Each iteration is computationally cheaper than full-batch gradient descent.
Better exploration: The randomness in updates helps escape local minima.
Higher variance: The noisier updates may lead to less stable convergence, requiring techniques like learning rate decay or momentum to improve performance.
Slower convergence: Since updates are less precise, SGD may take longer to reach the optimal solution.
Conclusion
SGD, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, and Batch Gradient Descent each offer different trade-offs in terms of speed, stability, and computational efficiency. In practice, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent is the most commonly used approach for deep learning, as it provides a balance between computational efficiency and convergence stability.",,,,"$$

Model,Algorithm,Linear Regression,"Models the relationship between an independent variable ( X ) and a dependent variable ( Y ) using a linear function. Model strengths include : Simple, interpretable, computationally efficient, works well for linearly separable data. Weaknesses, Assumes linear relationships, sensitive to outliers. Can calculate using two different approaches, Closed Form or Gradient Decent. Closed Form Solution was the original approach, can be calculated using advanced Calculus, which is easy for simple instances with a low number of independent variables, however Gradient Decent increasingly utilized as easy to implement via numeric calculation,  Python Linear Regression utilizies Pseudoinverse, which is computationally less expensive. However, it is Big O 2² to 2³, which means doubling features increases computations complexity 4 times.

Cost function for Linear Regression is usually Mean Squared Error. While it does not have to be, it is convenient for a number of reasons. 
1) Rarely Overfits, which Polynomial equations frequently do. 
2) It always has a derivative, which makes it convenient for using closed forms solutions (saving computation complexity). Historically was applied via Closed Form Solution, which can be difficult to calculate, computationally expensive. ",,,,"$$
Y = w_0 + w_1 X + \epsilon

$$
$$
MSE = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2
$$

A linear model can be written as:

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X} \boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\epsilon}
$$

where:
- $( \mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1})$ is the vector of observed values
- $( \mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p} )$ is the design matrix (with \( n \) samples and \( p \) features),
- $( \boldsymbol{\beta} \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times 1} )$ is the vector of coefficients,
- $( \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1} )$ is the error term.

The closed-form solution for the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate of \( \boldsymbol{\beta} \) is:

$$
\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{y}
$$

provided that $( \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X} )$ is invertible.

This formula is derived by minimizing the sum of squared errors:

$$
\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\beta}) = \|\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X} \boldsymbol{\beta} \|^2
$$

Taking the derivative with respect to $( \boldsymbol{\beta} )$ and setting it to zero:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \boldsymbol{\beta}} = -2 \mathbf{X}^T (\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X} \boldsymbol{\beta}) = 0

Solving for $( \boldsymbol{\beta} )$ gives the closed-form solution above.

Logistic Regression is used for **binary classification**. It predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class.

- Otherwise, predict class **0**.

ModelStrengths: Effective in high-dimensional spaces, works well with clear margins of separation. Model Weaknesses:Computationally expensive, struggles with large datasets.",,,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derek-dewald/d_functions/main/images/SVM.png,"### Support Vector Machine (SVM) Formula

For a binary classification problem with data points $(x_i, y_i)$, where $x_i \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $y_i \in \{-1, 1\}$, the equation of the hyperplane is: $\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x} + b = 0$.

Where:
- $\mathbf{w}$ is the weight vector (normal to the hyperplane),
- $b$ is the bias term,
- $\mathbf{x}$ is the feature vector.

### Optimization Objective

The goal is to maximize the margin $\frac{2}{\|\mathbf{w}\|}$ while ensuring correct classification of all points. This is formulated as:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{w}, b} \ \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{w}\|^2
$$

**Subject to the constraints:**

$$
y_i(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}_i + b) \geq 1, \quad \forall i
