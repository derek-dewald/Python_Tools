Process,Title,Header,Description
Problem Solving,Problem Definition,Clearly Defined Problem Statement,"Problem statement should include a clear, specific, well considered, and relate to a meaningful solvable, problem. Additionally, the problem statement should highlight why the issue is relavant, and how the problem is known to exist (Facts, Stats, Magnitude)."
Problem Solving,Problem Definition,Current State,"It is critically important that problems are substantiated, clear, and comprehensively understood, at both executive and L6 levels. It is important to have 360 perspective of what the problem is, not simply 1 persons, or a small groups perspective (regardless of how influential that individual is)."
Problem Solving,Problem Definition,Historical Context,"You can not create a best in class solution, without knowing what has come before, why those solutions did not fully satisfy, and where the risks lie."
Problem Solving,Brainstorming,Resource Determination,"What resources will be required to understand, develop solution and implemented solution. Resources include, Data, Technology, People, $$$."
Problem Solving,Solution Requirements,Define reequirements of solution,"Identify the parameters to the desired solution. Include Required, Desired and Nice to Have, score each. Be sure to define expectations and assumptions about base expectations to avoid circumstances where crtical functionality or influence is not omitted."
Problem Solving,Solution Development,Develop atleast 3 viable recommendations,"Utilizing the triadic approach, identify atleast 3 viable alternatives to a solution"
Problem Solving,Scoring Framework,Score Solutions,"Develop a scoring criteria primarily based on Requirements, including Value Weighted based on importance. Can add compoennt related to expected cost directly in scoring (can also be distinct, especially if there is minimal difference)."
Problem Solving,Solution Proposal,Final Validation,"After reviewing scoring, review each of the solutions, and make 1 final assessment, Is it Possible? Is it Practical? Can we do it? Have we done it before? Is it a material improvement over the status quo."
Problem Solving,Solution Proposal,Solution Recommendation,"A clear, logically based articulation of what the proposed solution is. It should include a minimum of a summarized version of what the solution is, why it relavant and how it would be monitored for success. A longer summary should be available (although not presented to executive level sponsor) which elaporates on key points including; alternatives considered, how decison was made and how all problems and opporuntities identified relate to the recommendation."
Machine Learning Project,Problem Definition,Problem Definition,"Has the problem been cleared defined and scopred? If no, then refer to Problem Solving Procress."
Machine Learning Project,Solutioning,Requirements,"Have requirements of the solution been explicitly defined, articulated and validated with stakeholders. Do we know exactly how a model will be used?"
Machine Learning Project,Solutioning,Utilization,"Has the future state process been defined? Can you explain Exacty how the output will be used, and has this been validated as useful and practical with end user."
Machine Learning Project,Solutioning,Performance Measurement,"Can the impact of the model be measured, Will it be measured? Has a baseline expectation been set, how are unintented consequences being managed."

Machine Learning Project,Model Conceptualization,"If any core components of desired end state are missing from solutions, validate with Stakeholders to clarify before proceeding forward",
Machine Learning Project,Model Conceptualization,"Where possible, try to retain as much flexibility and optionality as possible, explicilty noting development time required for baseline solution",
Machine Learning Project,Data Collection,"Identify Data Elements which are required, desired, and available",
Machine Learning Project,Data Collection,Locate and Confirm Data Availability,"Ensure accountability of this action is clear, where data is not available what will be done, change approach, obtain data, engineer data?"
Machine Learning Project,Data Collection,Completed Dictionary for all data elements included,
Machine Learning Project,Data Collection,"For elements which are not available, ensure individuals are assigned as Data Stewards and a delivery dates (including refresh requirements are identified)",
Machine Learning Project,Data Collection,"For new data, ensure Data Validaion, Quality and refresh frequency are explicitly dicussed and ownership for each assigned",
