ML Models,Linear Regression,"Closed Form Solution. Python Linear Regression utilizies Pseudoinverse, which is computationally less expensive. However, it is Big O 2² to 2³, which means doubling features increases computations complexity 4 times."

Decision Making,Criteria,What is the criteria being used other than make this decision?
Decision Making,Criteria,How do the criteria compare?
Decision Making,Criteria,"Remember, it is important to know what Big Decisions which occur less frequently need differnet criteria for both decisions and measurement."
Decision Making,Emotions,"Our emotions, preconceptions, political affiliations badly wrap the way we interpret evidence."
Decision Making,Emotions,Political decisions shape what statistics we gather and share and what we ignore and conceal.
Decision Making,Emotions,Doubt is our product.
Decision Making,Emotions,"Don’t convince smokers cigarettes aren’t bad, just that the evidence which suggested they were dangerous was questionable."
Decision Making,Emotions,Biases appear negatively. People can argue against what they don’t like.
Decision Making,Statistics,Statistics show us things we can’t see in any other way.
Decision Making,Statistics,We depend on reliable data to shape our decisions. Often only collect in the face of adversity.
Decision Making,Confusion,Offering more choices sometimes motivates and sometimes demotivates people.
Hypothesis Testing,Structure,HARK is an acronym for Hypothesizing After Results Known.
Hypothesis Testing,Structure,"Standard statistical tests assume that the researcher made the choice before collecting the data, then collected data, then ran the test. If the researcher ran several tests, then made a choice, flukes are vastly more likely."
Hypothesis Testing,Structure,"For obvious reasons, this particular flavor of survivorship bias is called “publication bias.” Interesting findings are published; non-findings, or failures to replicate previous findings, face a higher publication hurdle."
,,"Out of all the possible studies that could have been conducted, it’s reasonable to guess that the journal was interested only in the ones that demonstrated precognition."
Visualizations,How people Interpret,"Christ at Emmaus - Feelings can trump expertise. We find ways to dismiss evidence we don’t like, when it supports our preconceptions we are less likely to look for flaws."
Visualizations,What Am I looking at.,The bigger display with a wider array of jams attracted more customers but very few of them actually bought jam. The display that offered fewer choices inspired more sales.[1] The counterintuitive result went viral—it hit a sweet spot. People respond better to fewer choices!
,,"Sample error reflects the risk that, purely by chance, a randomly chosen sample of opinions does not reflect the true views of the population. The “margin of error” reported in opinion polls reflects this risk, and the larger the sample, the smaller the margin of error. A thousand interviews is a large enough sample for many purposes, and during the 1936 election campaign Mr. Gallup is reported to have conducted three thousand interviews."
,,Sampling error is when a randomly chosen sample doesn’t reflect the underlying population purely by chance; sampling bias is when the sample isn’t randomly chosen at all. George Gallup took pains to find an unbiased sample because he knew that was far more important than finding a big one.
,,"Kate Crawford, a researcher at Microsoft, has assembled many examples of when N = All assumptions have led people astray. When Hurricane Sandy hit the New York City area in 2012, researchers published an analysis of data from Twitter and a location-based search engine, Foursquare, showing that they could track a spike in grocery shopping the day before and a boom for bars and nightclubs the day after. That’s fine, as far as it goes—but those tweets about the hurricane were disproportionately from Manhattan, whereas areas such as Coney Island had been hit much harder. In fact, Coney Island had been hit so hard the electricity was out—that was why nobody there was tweeting—while densely populated and prosperous Manhattan was unusually saturated with smartphones, at least by 2012 standards, when they were less ubiquitous than today.

,,"who respond to Literary Digest surveys” differ in some consistent way from “people who vote in elections.” Google Flu Trends captured every Google search, but not everybody who gets the flu turns to Google. Its accuracy depended on “people with flu who consult Google about it” not being systematically different from “people with flu.”"
,,"Just like people, algorithms are neither trustworthy nor untrustworthy as a general class. Just as with people, rather than asking, “Should we trust algorithms?” we should ask, “Which algorithms can we trust, and what can we trust them to do?”
"
,,"Has the performance of the algorithm been assessed rigorously—for example, by running a randomized trial to see if people make better decisions with or without algorithmic advice? Have independent experts been given a chance to evaluate the algorithm? What have they concluded? We should not simply trust that algorithms are doing a better job than humans, nor should we assume that if the algorithms are flawed, the humans would be flawless."
,,When someone tells a joke poorly it is more likely than not that they have forgotten to convey an important piece of information in the set up that makes the punch line funny. So it seems the joke is in the set up and not the punch line.

Competition is not a theme. Competition is a necessary evil, is a theme.

The armature is your point that your story is build around.
To get your point across, you must understand it. Most people can’t isolate their message, they want to say something deep and profound, but end up saying nothing.
ET, Iron Giant, Terminator, There’s Something About Mary.
Punchline uses everything in the story, else why is it there. Can only use what is there, or it doesn’t make sense.

Seeing is different than being told.
Use of clones to teach our main character/

Ritual pain leads to growth.
Find the thing your character would rather die than do, and make them do it.

Learn to hear what they mean, not what they say.
If there is something wrong with the third act, there is something wrong with the first act.
If you hear the same critique from 3 or more people, listen. But it might be Symptom not the disease. 
People try and make you on their own image.
It’s not about the grammar. It’s about the story.


Informing this decision should be the philosophical assumptions the researcher brings to the study; procedures of inquiry (called research designs); and specific research methods of data collection, analysis, and interpretation. The selection of a research approach is also based on the nature of the research problem or issue being addressed, the researchers’ personal experiences, and the audiences for the study.
