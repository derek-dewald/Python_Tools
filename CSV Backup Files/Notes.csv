Machine Learning,Feature Selection,Important to Remember,"Avoid ambigious features. Is a Banana ripe, who says so?"
Machine Learning,Feature Selection,Important to Remember,"Careful when something is truly random generated, Atmospheric Change, Earthquakes, Stocks. Very difficult, if not impossible to predict."

Machine Learning,Model,Goal,"Need to carefully balance your objective, with what the Model Type actually does and be explicitly clear on Goal. What are you actually attempting to calculate when maximizing or minimizing, what is prioritized, Training Performance, or ability to Generalize.  Strive to avoid overfitting, maximize ability to Generalize."
Machine Learning,Model,Important to Remeber,Is your Data Structured in a way that is conducive to your Model.
Machine Learning,Model,Important to Remeber,"Any data set can be optimized, even when there is NO relation. It will generalize."
Machine Learning,Model,Important to Remeber,"An Example of this would a classification model with Wolves and Dogs,  many wolf photos happened to be taken in snowy environments, while dog photos were often taken indoors or on grass. The model learned to detect snow, not animals."
Machine Learning,Model,Important to Remeber,"Models will cheat and can solve problems which appear to be optimal, but they might not be solving what you expect or require, they might be finding patterns in the data which you do not see. An Example of this would a classification model with Wolves and Dogs,  many wolf photos happened to be taken in snowy environments, while dog photos were often taken indoors or on grass. The model learned to detect snow, not animals."
Machine Learning,Model,Lesson Learnt,"An Example of this would a classification model with Wolves and Dogs,  many wolf photos happened to be taken in snowy environments, while dog photos were often taken indoors or on grass. The model learned to detect snow, not animals."
