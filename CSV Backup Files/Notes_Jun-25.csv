Deep Learning,Evolution,"Historical Issue of gradient propogration where signal would fade through the layers was solved through, better activation functions, optimization schemes and weight initializing."
Deep Learning,Framework,"Core building block is the layer, a filter which creates a representation, can chain simple layers into a complex one. "
Deep Learning,Model,"Model starts with determining the number of layers, type of connections, and activation functions. Once model is defined, to comile need to determine, Optimizer, Loss Function and Metric."

Tensor,Dimensions,"Rank 2: Vector (Sample, Features). A grouping of examples, with same features as values, basic Linear Regression Data."
Tensor,Dimensions,"Rank 3: Matrix(Sample, Timestamp, Features). Traditional Time Series Data (Also grey scale images). A grouping of examples with a sequence and features."
Tensor,Dimensions,"Rank 4. (Sample, Height, Width, Channel). Grid of 2D pixels, where each pixel is represented by a vector of values (channel)."
Tensor,Dimensions,"Rank 5. Video (Sample, Frame, Height, Width, Channel) where each sample is a sequence (of length frames) of images."

ML Models,Ridge Regression,"Also used as a regularization, sometimes only as regularization. Only added during Training. Model Weights Close to 0.L2"
ML Models,Lasso Regression,"Also used as a regularization, sometimes only as regularization. Only added during Training. Reduces weights of least important variables. L1"
ML Models,Linear Regression,"Closed Form Solution. Python Linear Regression utilizies Pseudoinverse, which is computationally less expensive. However, it is Big O 2² to 2³, which means doubling features increases computations complexity 4 times."
ML Models,Gradient Descent,"Generic optimization algorithm,  which tweaks parameters iteratively in order to minimize cost function. Requires key inputs, learning rate, Cost Function. Initialization can be important, as can local/Global Minimum. Different types, Itterative Gradient Decsent (Batch, Mini, Stochastic). "
Machine Learning,Optimization,"In 9 dimensions, might not be global minimum, a series of good solutions."
Machine Learning,Optimization,Small change hypothesis must hold.  Example Weather does not hold. Chaos.
Machine Learning,Optimization,"Models will cheat. Self-driving car, multi lane highway or blur."
