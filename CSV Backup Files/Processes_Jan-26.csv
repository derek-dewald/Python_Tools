D Project Partcipation Guidelines,Guiding Principle,Definition,"D Project Partcipation Guidelines are set up to formulate a baseline commitment of the process I have agreed to follow in every scenario. While I may not explicitly answer every question everytime, I should for my own benefit. Document the process and my thought/rationale to proceeding to help to provide clarity, consistency and forces one to think about the scenario from different perspectives and leave a history. How many times have I made mistakes, missed pertinent facts, duplicated work, or just simply done unnecessary work because I haven't ask the right questions, lost track of purpose, misunderstood, assumed incorrect, or incorrectly lost focus on the ultimate deliverable because I didnt have a clear enough focus/purpose."

Problem Definition,Guiding Principle,Definition,"Process created to provide a framework for understanding a problem. If you do not fully understand a problem, it is very difficult to identiy a meaningful and appropriate solution, and as a result this is often the most important component of a project, endeavor or task. While there is a real issue of Analysis Paralysis which must be managed, it is critical that consideration be given to work, and that a proporation amount of time is invested in this step. A rough guideline of total expected time spent of Problem Definition would be 5-15%, with the more complex the Problem, the more time allocated on definition."
Problem Definition,Step 1: Definition,What Type of Problem or Question is it?,"TBD: Need to Create a List of Types of Problems and QUESTIONS and store this somewhere. 


Complexity. Resources Required. Responsibility. etc."
Problem Definition,Step 2: Problem Statement,Explicitly Define the Problem Statement,"Problem statement should include a clear, specific, well considered, and relate to a meaningful solvable, problem. Additionally, the problem statement should highlight why the issue is relavant, and how the problem is known to exist (Facts, Stats, Magnitude)."
Problem Definition,Step 2: Problem Statement,Is the Root Cause Included in Problem Statement,
Problem Definition,Step 3: Context,Why is this Important?,"It is critically important that problems are substantiated, clear, and comprehensively understood. The Problem Definition should articulate this, and represent a clear full and appropriate picture."
Problem Definition,Step 3: Context,How has this been determined?,"It is important to remember how the definition of Important has been derived. Ideally a current state analysis would be completed, which looks at the existing process, historical context, relevant projects on the go, or historical projects which have attempted to solve the issue and outcomes, finding and learnings from these."
Problem Definition,Step 3: Context,Who says so?,"It is important to have 360 perspective of what the problem is, where has the definition been sourced, and who has contributed. Does it represent a full and fair picture? Does it have sufficient endorsement?"
Problem Definition,Step 4: Impact,"If we DO this, we will be able to....","Where possible, this should be described in measurable terms, Hours Saved, New Deposits Earned, New Loans Issued, Dollars Revenue earned, etc."
Problem Definition,Step 4: Impact,"If we DO this, the following individuals will be impacted ...","A list of Individuals who are impacted and by default should be provided the opportunity to be included in discussion, or at a minimum provided notification of key decisions."
Problem Definition,Step 4: Impact,If we DO NOT this the following will or could occur ...,"Where possible, this should be described in measurable terms, Manual Hours Spent to recreate, Deposits Loans Lost, Regulator Commitments not met, processes which will not be met. If something is manually occuring now, the impact is lost opportunity, not the cost of current process. "
Problem Definition,Step 4: Impact,"If we DO Not do this, the following individuals will be impacted ...","A list of Individuals who are impacted and by default should be provided the opportunity to be included in discussion, or at a minimum provided notification of key decisions."
Goal Setting,Guiding Principle,Definition,"Process created to provide a framework for effectively guiding the solutioning of a problem. Goal setting is important for a number of reasons, including; managing expectations, minimizing resource spend,  alligning resources, and explicitly defining the requirements. A rough guideline of total expected time spent of Goal Setting would be 5-15%, with the more complex the Problem, the more time allocated on definition."
Goal Setting,Step 1: Definition,"What are the Goals, Purpose or Expected Outcomes.","What is the desired Goal? Appreciating that the definition of a Goal is somewhat ambigious and up for interpretation, ideally it will be split into 2 Section. Section 1: Goal. Section 2: Expected Outcomes. With the goal relating to higher organizational strategic plans and positioning, with the exepected outcomes, more granular measurable components. The respective Why and What."
Goal Setting,Step 1: Definition,Goal Statement,"Stated Goal, which at a minimum it should allign with organizational strategy, and clearly articulate why this is a intellegent investment of organizational resources. Where this materially changes, or is deviated from, it should be escalated and understood, while it is understandable and even expected that it will occur, the process of resource allocation and accountability needs to be considered, so it should be documented and challenged where appropriate."
Goal Setting,Step 1: Definition,List Expected Outcomes,"List of expected outcomes which will be achieved from project/process. These should be clear, explicitly stated and align with organizational process. Where process is not documented it should be noted, and ownership clearly assigned."
Goal Setting,Step 2: Measurability,"Can the Expected Outcomes be listed, prioritized,  classified and measured?","If a Expected Outcome can not be measured, should it be included, or does a new definition, process or outcome need to be considered."
Goal Setting,Step 2: Measurability,"If Not, How are they going to be Created?",
Goal Setting,Step 2: Measurability,Can Baseline Expectations be set for Measurable Expected Outcomes..,
Approach Development,Guiding Principle,Definition,"Process created to provide a framework for effectively exploring which approach to solution development. While approach development seems like the most complex (and it can be), to be successful it is highly reliant on the Problem Definition and Goal Setting components, as not understanding the Root Cause and Business Need for a solution, can (and often does) result in technically correct, but practically useless solutions. The idea is to really understand the business need, and develop a solution which meets the needs, in a simple, straight forward and consistent manner."
Approach Development,Step 1: Definition,,
Approach Development,Step 2: Scoring,Develop Scoring System & Weighting based on Goal and Expected Outcomes.,"Include Value Weighted based on importance, requirements, expected outcomes and likelihood. Can add component related to expected cost directly in scoring (can also be distinct, especially if there is minimal difference)."
Approach Development,Step 2: Scoring,Avoiding Bias,"Scoring is considered as a initial step in an attempt to reduce bias, and group think. While there remains plenty of opportunities to bias selection still, defining a scoring system early helps to mitigate and defend decision against critical rebukes."
Approach Development,Step 3: Triadic Approach,Identify more than 1 Viable Approach.,Triadic Approach. 
Approach Development,Step 4: Review,"Review Merits of Solutions, identify misses or questions.","Important to identify residual questions, omissions or doubts which have come up during the process of identifying benefits and shortcomings of potential solutions. Specifically, omissions, things which may not have originally been considered but are now, known, expected or concerns which might undermine success of implementation. "
Approach Development,Step 5: Selection,Present Options,"Ensure that the information is presented in a clear, concise and fair manner. The opportunity for individuals to ask questions, ensure they have a full, fair and complete informaiton should exist. The expectation is not that one spends hundreds of hours on Powerpoint Presentations and Decks, or attempts to defer all responsibility, rather to encourage, engage and educate on the merits, risks, and opportunities. Recommendations are fine and appropriate where warranted."
Approach Development,Step 5: Selection,Select Desired Approach,"Ensure that aggreement is actually made. Ensure that questions, doubts or concerns are documented and understood. As an example, if someone reframes from opining, in a offline setting follow up and ask them what their concerns are, to understand the difference between indifference, uncertainty, and opposition. The goal is to develop both organizational and individual muscles that make better, faster and more informed decisions."
Approach Development,Step 5: Selection,Select Desired Approach,"Note. Depending Upon Complexity, the decision might be to proceed forwrard with multiple potential solutions. If this is the case, would simply concurrently run process."
Data Gathering,Guiding Principle,Definition,"Data Gathering is a critical component as without high quality, consistent and available data, the ability to create meaningful models does not exist. Data needs to be available, automated and of high quality. Where it does not exist, it is important to understand what can/will be done in order to supplement. Must be ready and able to document and call out critical omissions, as they will undermine."
Data Gathering,Step 1: Definition,Does the Data Exist?,"Does the Data Currently Exist. If no, then ensure it is understood what limitation exist and how they will impact. Where the data doesn't exist, discenable action should be taken on individuals to create, or take responsibility/ ownership for creation."
Data Gathering,Step 1: Definition,Does the Data Exist?,"Explicitly Define Where Data Set: Manual, Ad Hoc, Part of ETL Process"
Data Gathering,Step 2: Documentation,Is Data Documented,"If yes, then reference, if no then who is going to create, and if it's not available, who is going injest, define and document."
Data Gathering,Step 3: Data Appropriateness,Is the Data Appropraite for the Model/ Approached Pursuing,Representative. Time Appropriate.  Not Redundant/ Duplicated.
Data Gathering,Step 4: Identify and Document Resources ,Resources Required,"Given complexity of task, important to define Roles and Responsibilities in this avenue. And where resources or contigency are limited, should be identified as risks."
Data Exploration and Modelling,Guiding Principle,Definition,"Data Exploration is a CRITICALLY important factor in the determination of sucess of any project, as a lack of integrity will undermine inference in every capacity. "
Data Exploration and Modelling,Step 1: Definition,Is the Data Clean?,"To answer this question one must have completed a review of the data and analyzed. Before proceeding forward this question should be expliclty answered, and if the answer is No, then a determination should be made, should I prioceed forward. If no, then escalate. If Yes, the documentation of how one arrived at that conculsion should be had. If No one can reasonably attest to data quality, while it would be ideal to wait, the task of validation can be delegated and work can proceed. But it is important, someone needs to take the responsibility away."
Data Exploration and Modelling,Step 2: Peform DQ Analysis,Store Analyzed Data,"Run DQ Validation, which might include Comparison DQ Validation. Document results and feedback, which MUST be shared with stakeholders."
Data Exploration and Modelling,Step 3: Clean Data,"Apply Data Cleaning, Communicate Application.","It is important that this is Documented and that individuals understand both what has been applied and how it will impact. Where assumptions are required to be made, they should be documented and communicated, with as best as possible a explanation as to the impact. IE. I will be removing extreme outliers from the Data, this will ensure that the impact of extreme observation does not skew resutls, however what it will mean is that the model will not be good a predicing or recognizing thee observations."
Data Exploration and Modelling,Step 3: Clean Data,"Apply Data Cleaning, Communicate Application.",Infer or Delete Missing Data
Data Exploration and Modelling,Step 4: Feature Engineering,"Apply Scaling, Normalization, and determine whether appropriate to create other features.","Apply Scaling, Normalization, and determine whether appropriate to create other features. Document where appropriate"
Data Exploration and Modelling,Step 5: Feature Selection,Select Relevant Features,"Run Pipeline, and apply manual enhancements as appropriate. Document and Communicate as appropriate, where decisions are required, seek appropriate feedback."
ML Pipeline,Guiding Principle,,
ML Pipeline,Step 1: Definition,,
ML Pipeline,Step 1: Definition,Has Usage Been Explicitly Defined,"It is CRITICALLY important, that how this model will be created and what will be required for ongoing maintenance is understood and known prior to development, as if data won't be available, or it will change constantly, the value and relevance of the model might be in question."
ML Pipeline,Step 2: Model Selection,Select Models or Pipeline as Appropriate to Include in Pipeline,"Document Mathematical Rationale and Approach, you should be able to explain with X problem a great solution is Y because of.... Ensure Cost Benefit Component is Documented and understood as part of analysis. Where relevant talk about Speed vs Accuracy. KPI Metrics, Model Selection Criteria"
