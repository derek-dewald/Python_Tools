Machine Learning,Definition,Area Under the Curve,"AUC (Area Under the Curve) measures a model’s ability to distinguish between classes by summarizing the performance of the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve. It represents the probability that the model ranks a randomly chosen positive example higher than a randomly chosen negative one. AUC ranges from 0.5 (no better than chance) to 1.0 (perfect separation), with higher values indicating better classification performance.
AUC is primarily a binary classification metric, so when using against a multivariate challenge must determine how to score, OVR, OVO. One Vs Rest, One vs One. Using MNist as an example, OVR evaluates 10 0 vs (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), 1 vs () ... etc, Where OVO measures 45 0 Vs 1, 0 vs 2, etc..",1.0
Machine Learning,Definition,Autoregressive,"Autoregressive models generate outputs one step at a time, where each prediction depends on the previously generated outputs. This sequential dependency allows the model to capture context and coherence, making it powerful for tasks like language modeling and time-series forecasting. However, because predictions are made step by step, autoregressive methods can be slower at inference compared to parallel approaches.",1.0
Machine Learning,Definition,Bias,"Bias refers to the systematic error in a model that causes it to consistently deviate from the true value or correct predictions. It occurs when an algorithm makes incorrect assumptions or omissions about the data, leading to errors.
High Bias (Underfitting): The model is too simple and cannot capture patterns. 
Low Bias, High Variance (Overfitting). The model memorizes the data but does not generalize.",1.0
Machine Learning,Definition,Bias - Variance Trade Off,"The bias-variance trade-off is a key concept in machine learning that highlights the balance between two sources of error: bias and variance, tuning the relationship between a model's complexity, the accuracy of its predictions, and how well it can make predictions on previously unseen data that were not used to train the model The challenge is to find a model that strikes the right balance between bias and variance, as reducing one typically increases the other. The ultimate goal is to minimize the total error, which is the sum of bias error, variance error, and irreducible noise inherent in the data. Achieving this balance ensures the model generalizes well to new, unseen data, avoiding both underfitting and overfitting. More Data vs More Data Science - Bias vs Variance 
It can often be explained by the Trade-Off (Bias - Data Scientist, Variance - Data), where to invest.

In general, as we increase the number of tunable parameters in a model, it becomes more flexible, and can better fit a training data set. It is said to have lower error, or bias. However, for more flexible models, there will tend to be greater variance to the model fit each time we take a set of samples to create a new training data set. It is said that there is greater variance in the model's estimated parameters.High-variance learning methods may be able to represent their training set well but are at risk of overfitting to noisy or unrepresentative training data. In contrast, algorithms with high bias typically produce simpler models that may fail to capture important regularities (i.e. underfit) in the data.",1.0
Machine Learning,Definition,Cross Validation,"Model evaluation technique used to assess how well a model generalizes to unseen data by repeatedly splitting the dataset into training and validation subsets. The model is trained on one portion of the data and evaluated on another, and the results are aggregated to provide a more reliable estimate of performance than a single train–test split. This approach helps detect overfitting and supports more robust model selection",1.0
Machine Learning,Definition,Curse of Dimensionality,"As dimensionality grows, data points become increasingly sparse, distances lose meaning, and models require exponentially more data to learn reliable patterns. This makes learning, generalization, and computation more difficult, often degrading model performance rather than improving it. In high-dimensional spaces, the optimization landscape also becomes far more complex, with many local minima and saddle points, making it harder to identify or converge toward a meaningful global minimum.",1.0
Machine Learning,Definition,Deep Learning,"Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layer neural networks to automatically learn hierarchical representations from data, reducing the need for manual feature engineering. By stacking simple processing units called layers—each acting as a filter that transforms inputs into higher-level representations—deep learning models can capture complex patterns through composition. Early challenges such as vanishing gradients, where learning signals faded through many layers, were largely addressed through improved activation functions, optimization methods, and weight initialization strategies. In practice, building a deep learning model involves defining the network architecture (number of layers, connections, and activations) and then specifying how it learns by choosing an optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics during compilation.",1.0
Machine Learning,Definition,Machine Learning,"Using a process to enable computers to iteratively learn from the data and improve analysis, outcomes or understanding. Intersection of statistics, artificial intelligence and computer science. Machine's don't learn, they find optimal mathematical formulas based on the data it is presented. There is an assumption that this data set is both representative of other data sets,  and possess similiar statistical distributions', You can argue this is not learning, because slight variances can result in materially different responses and output, Term synonymous with machines doing tasks without explicitly being programmed. Building a statistical model, based on a dataset",1.0
Machine Learning,Definition,Optimization,"Optimization is the process of finding the best possible solution to a problem by systematically adjusting inputs or decisions to maximize or minimize a defined objective, subject to given constraints. In machine learning and analytics, optimization involves selecting model parameters that minimize error or maximize performance according to a chosen loss function. Importantly, what is considered “best” depends entirely on how the objective and constraints are defined.",1.0

The agent learns a policy that maximizes cumulative reward over time through trial and error. It is commonly used in robotics, game playing, and control systems.",1.0
Machine Learning,Definition,Semisupervised Learning,Semi-supervised learning combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data to improve learning performance. The model leverages the structure in the unlabeled data to generalize better than supervised learning alone. This approach is useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.,1.0
Machine Learning,Definition,Supervised Learning,"Supervised learning trains a model using labeled data, where the correct answer is known in advance. The model learns a mapping from inputs to outputs by minimizing the difference between its predictions and the true labels. Common examples include classification and regression problems.",1.0
Machine Learning,Definition,Unsupervised Learning,"Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data and aims to discover hidden patterns or structure. The model groups, compresses, or summarizes the data without being told what the correct outcome is. Typical use cases include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.",1.0
Machine Learning,Definition,Variance,"Variance refers to errors caused by models that are too sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data, often resulting in overfitting. High-variance models are overly flexible, capturing noise as if it were meaningful patterns. A model with many degrees of freedom (such as a high-degree polynomial model) is likely to have high variance and thus overfit the training data. As an example, if you created a model of How Predicting Housing Prices in 1 Neighbourhood would work and applied it to different neighbourhoods, if your model was simple, it wouldn’t work well anywhere and thus would be Wrong, but consistently-ish wrong. If your model was Good, it would work similarly well every well. If you model was overfit, it would work really well in 1 place, not so well elsewhere.
",1.0
Machine Learning,Definition,Regularization,"Technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. It discourages the model from fitting too closely to the training data, ensuring better generalization to unseen data. Traditionnaly results in bias, at benefit of materially lowering Variance. Regularization is a Constraint.",1.0
Machine Learning,Definition,Model Summarization / Model Interpretability,"Model summarization and interpretability aim to explain how the model makes decisions. This may include feature importance, partial dependence plots, SHAP values, or rule extraction. Interpretability builds trust with stakeholders and supports debugging, governance, and compliance. It is especially critical in high-stakes or regulated domains.",1.0
Machine Learning,Definition,Activation Function,"A mathematical function applied to a neuron’s weighted input that introduces non-linearity into a neural network. This non-linearity enables the model to learn complex, non-linear relationships in the data. Activation functions are applied within layers during the forward pass of a neural network, transforming intermediate representations before passing them to the next layer. Activation choice affects gradient flow, training stability, and convergence speed. Poor choices can cause vanishing or exploding gradients, limiting the depth or effectiveness of the network",1.0
Machine Learning,Definition,Loss Function,"A loss function is a mathematical function that measures how far a model’s predictions are from the true target values, producing a single scalar value that represents prediction error and defines the objective to be minimized during training. The loss function is evaluated during training after the forward pass and is the starting point for backpropagation. Its gradients drive parameter updates via the optimizer. Different loss functions encode different assumptions about error, robustness, and business objectives. Choosing an inappropriate loss can lead to models that optimize the wrong behavior, even if training converges successfully.",1.0
Machine Learning,Definition,Optimizer,"Optimization algorithm that updates a model’s parameters using gradients of the loss function in order to minimize training error. It defines how gradient information is transformed into parameter updates. The optimizer operates during training, after gradients are computed via backpropagation, and is not used during inference. Different optimizers trade off convergence speed, stability, and generalization. Hyperparameters such as learning rate and momentum are",1.0
Machine Learning,Definition,Instance Based Learning,"Instance-Based Learning is a learning paradigm where predictions or inferences are made by directly comparing new observations to stored examples rather than learning an explicit global model. It answers the question: “What past observations most closely resemble this one?” Its strengths are simplicity, transparency, and flexibility, as it makes few assumptions about the underlying data structure. Its weaknesses include sensitivity to feature scaling and noise, lack of global summarization, and higher computational cost at inference time for large datasets",1.0

It classifies data based on meaning—such as whether a variable reflects behaviour (actions over time), structure (relatively stable state or capacity), or context (situational or explanatory attributes). For example, POS Transaction 6-Month Average is behavioural because it captures repeated member activity, while Deposit Balance is structural because it reflects financial position. Classifying semantic type is important because it prevents mixing fundamentally different concepts in ways that distort model behaviour, improves interpretability, and ensures feature choices align with the intended analytical objective.",1.0
Machine Learning,Definition,Functional Role ,"Describes how a variable is used within a specific model or modeling process, rather than what it represents conceptually. It classifies variables based on whether they actively shape the model (core), help interpret results (descriptive), or evaluate model quality and stability (diagnostic). For example, POS Transaction 6-Month Average may be a core variable that defines clusters, while Assignment Margin is diagnostic because it evaluates how confidently members are assigned. Classifying functional role is critical in ML modeling—especially in unsupervised learning—because it makes modeling assumptions explicit, prevents unintended variables from shaping outcomes, and enables controlled, explainable model evolution.",1.0

Machine Learning,Model,Algorithm,"Gradient Descent: Widely used optimization algorithm in machine learning, particularly for training models like neural networks. Its primary goal is to minimize a loss function, which measures the error between the model's predictions and the actual outcomes, by iteratively adjusting the model’s parameters.

Traditional Gradient Descent vs. Stochastic Gradient Descent
In Batch Gradient Descent, the algorithm computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model’s parameters using the entire dataset before updating the parameters. While this approach provides a precise update direction, it is computationally expensive and slow for large datasets since it requires processing all data points in each iteration.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) addresses this issue by approximating the gradient. Instead of computing gradients over the full dataset, SGD updates the model’s parameters using just a single data point at each step. This significantly reduces computational cost per iteration, making the algorithm much faster. However, since updates are based on a single random sample, they introduce high variance (noise), causing fluctuations that may prevent smooth convergence.
Mini-Batch Gradient Descent: To balance efficiency and stability, a common alternative is Mini-Batch Gradient Descent. Instead of using the full dataset (Batch Gradient Descent) or a single data point (SGD), Mini-Batch Gradient Descent computes updates using a small batch of randomly selected data points (e.g., 32, 64, or 128 samples per batch). This approach: Reduces noise compared to SGD while still being computationally efficient. 
Leverages vectorized operations for faster computation using modern hardware (e.g., GPUs).
Smooths out updates while still allowing some stochasticity to escape local minima.
Benefits & Trade-offs of SGD
Faster updates: Each iteration is computationally cheaper than full-batch gradient descent.
Better exploration: The randomness in updates helps escape local minima.
Higher variance: The noisier updates may lead to less stable convergence, requiring techniques like learning rate decay or momentum to improve performance.
Slower convergence: Since updates are less precise, SGD may take longer to reach the optimal solution.
Conclusion
SGD, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, and Batch Gradient Descent each offer different trade-offs in terms of speed, stability, and computational efficiency. In practice, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent is the most commonly used approach for deep learning, as it provides a balance between computational efficiency and convergence stability.",202.0
