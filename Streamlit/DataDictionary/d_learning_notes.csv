The appropriate model type is selected based on the problem context, data availability and quality, time constraints, business objectives, and resource limitations."
ML Model,Definition,Model Type,"Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning trains an agent to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties. The agent learns a policy that maximizes cumulative reward over time through trial and error. It is commonly used in robotics, game playing, and control systems."
ML Model,Definition,Model Type,Semisupervised Learning: Semi-supervised learning combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data to improve learning performance. The model leverages the structure in the unlabeled data to generalize better than supervised learning alone. This approach is useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.
ML Model,Definition,Model Type,"Supervised Learning: Supervised learning trains a model using labeled data, where the correct answer is known in advance. The model learns a mapping from inputs to outputs by minimizing the difference between its predictions and the true labels. Common examples include classification and regression problems."
ML Model,Definition,Model Type,"Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data and aims to discover hidden patterns or structure. The model groups, compresses, or summarizes the data without being told what the correct outcome is. Typical use cases include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection."

By stacking simple processing units called layers—each acting as a filter that transforms inputs into higher-level representations—deep learning models can capture complex patterns through composition. Early challenges such as vanishing gradients, where learning signals faded through many layers, were largely addressed through improved activation functions, optimization methods, and weight initialization strategies. In practice, building a deep learning model involves defining the network architecture (number of layers, connections, and activations) and then specifying how it learns by choosing an optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics during compilation."

Model strengths include : Simple, interpretable, computationally efficient, works well for linearly separable data. Weaknesses, Assumes linear relationships, sensitive to outliers.

ML Model,Algorithm,Gradient Descent,"Widely used optimization algorithm in machine learning, particularly for training models like neural networks. Its primary goal is to minimize a loss function, which measures the error between the model's predictions and the actual outcomes, by iteratively adjusting the model’s parameters.

Traditional Gradient Descent vs. Stochastic Gradient Descent
In Batch Gradient Descent, the algorithm computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model’s parameters using the entire dataset before updating the parameters. While this approach provides a precise update direction, it is computationally expensive and slow for large datasets since it requires processing all data points in each iteration.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) addresses this issue by approximating the gradient. Instead of computing gradients over the full dataset, SGD updates the model’s parameters using just a single data point at each step. This significantly reduces computational cost per iteration, making the algorithm much faster. However, since updates are based on a single random sample, they introduce high variance (noise), causing fluctuations that may prevent smooth convergence.
Mini-Batch Gradient Descent: To balance efficiency and stability, a common alternative is Mini-Batch Gradient Descent. Instead of using the full dataset (Batch Gradient Descent) or a single data point (SGD), Mini-Batch Gradient Descent computes updates using a small batch of randomly selected data points (e.g., 32, 64, or 128 samples per batch). This approach: Reduces noise compared to SGD while still being computationally efficient. 
Leverages vectorized operations for faster computation using modern hardware (e.g., GPUs).
Smooths out updates while still allowing some stochasticity to escape local minima.
Benefits & Trade-offs of SGD
Faster updates: Each iteration is computationally cheaper than full-batch gradient descent.
Better exploration: The randomness in updates helps escape local minima.
Higher variance: The noisier updates may lead to less stable convergence, requiring techniques like learning rate decay or momentum to improve performance.
Slower convergence: Since updates are less precise, SGD may take longer to reach the optimal solution.
Conclusion
SGD, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, and Batch Gradient Descent each offer different trade-offs in terms of speed, stability, and computational efficiency. In practice, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent is the most commonly used approach for deep learning, as it provides a balance between computational efficiency and convergence stability."

ML Project,Definition,Feature Selection,"Bias: Bias refers to the systematic error in a model that causes it to consistently deviate from the true value or correct predictions. It occurs when an algorithm makes incorrect assumptions or omissions about the data, leading to errors.
High Bias (Underfitting): The model is too simple and cannot capture patterns. 
Low Bias, High Variance (Overfitting). The model memorizes the data but does not generalize."
ML Project,Definition,Feature Selection,"Bias - Variance Trade Off: The bias-variance trade-off is a key concept in machine learning that highlights the balance between two sources of error: bias and variance, tuning the relationship between a model's complexity, the accuracy of its predictions, and how well it can make predictions on previously unseen data that were not used to train the model The challenge is to find a model that strikes the right balance between bias and variance, as reducing one typically increases the other. The ultimate goal is to minimize the total error, which is the sum of bias error, variance error, and irreducible noise inherent in the data. Achieving this balance ensures the model generalizes well to new, unseen data, avoiding both underfitting and overfitting. More Data vs More Data Science - Bias vs Variance 
It can often be explained by the Trade-Off (Bias - Data Scientist, Variance - Data), where to invest.

In general, as we increase the number of tunable parameters in a model, it becomes more flexible, and can better fit a training data set. It is said to have lower error, or bias. However, for more flexible models, there will tend to be greater variance to the model fit each time we take a set of samples to create a new training data set. It is said that there is greater variance in the model's estimated parameters.High-variance learning methods may be able to represent their training set well but are at risk of overfitting to noisy or unrepresentative training data. In contrast, algorithms with high bias typically produce simpler models that may fail to capture important regularities (i.e. underfit) in the data."
ML Project,Definition,Feature Selection,"Variance: Variance refers to errors caused by models that are too sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data, often resulting in overfitting. High-variance models are overly flexible, capturing noise as if it were meaningful patterns. A model with many degrees of freedom (such as a high-degree polynomial model) is likely to have high variance and thus overfit the training data. As an example, if you created a model of How Predicting Housing Prices in 1 Neighbourhood would work and applied it to different neighbourhoods, if your model was simple, it wouldn’t work well anywhere and thus would be Wrong, but consistently-ish wrong. If your model was Good, it would work similarly well every well. If you model was overfit, it would work really well in 1 place, not so well elsewhere.

ML Project,Definition,Training,"Training is the process of fitting the model to data by optimizing its parameters to minimize a loss function. During training, the model learns patterns by iteratively adjusting weights based on observed errors. This step may involve batching, optimization algorithms, and regularization techniques. Proper training ensures the model captures meaningful signal without overfitting."

Monitoring is essential because real-world data changes, and models degrade if left unattended."
ML Project,Pipeline Stage,Evaluation,"Evaluation measures how well the final model performs against defined success metrics on a truly unseen test dataset.

Data Preparation,Operational Definition,Momentum,"Momentum represents the direction and rate of change in behavior over time. It answers the question “Is this entity increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable?” and captures transitional dynamics that are not visible from state or baseline alone. Momentum is critical for detecting emerging trends, shifts in behavior, and potential future movement between segments. In modeling, Momentum often explains why change is occurring rather than what the current condition is."
Data Preparation,Operational Definition,Implementation,"An Implementation is a specific measurable representation of a dimension, constructed from available data. It answers the question: “How do we observe this dimension in practice?” Implementations can change as data improves, but they should always map clearly back to a single dimension. Examples include; 6-month rolling average balance, 12-month median transaction value, Seasonally adjusted mean.
Ultimately it is the question, How do we measure it."
Data Preparation,Operational Definition,Volatility,"Volatility represents the consistency or variability of behavior over time. It answers the question “How stable or predictable is this entity’s behavior?” and distinguishes steady patterns from irregular or erratic ones. Volatility provides important diagnostic context, helping differentiate sustained change from noise or one-off events. In modeling, Volatility is typically explanatory or risk-related rather than defining core identity."
Data Preparation,Operational Definition,Baseline,"Baseline represents the typical or expected behavior of an entity over a meaningful historical period. It answers the question “What is normal for this entity?” and provides context against which current state and changes can be interpreted. Baseline is conceptually stable even when its numeric value evolves, allowing models to distinguish structural differences between entities from temporary deviations. In modeling, Baseline is often foundational for defining identity and long-term segmentation."
Data Preparation,Regularization,Ridge,"Technique used to prevent overfitting by adding penalty term to loss function. Adds the squared values of the coefficients as a penalty term. This incrases the cost of larger parameters, encouraging the model to distribute parameters waiting This shrinks the coefficients but does not eliminate them."
Data Preparation,Regularization,Lasso,"Technique used to prevent overfitting by adding penalty term to loss function. Adds the absolute values of the coefficients as a penalty term. This leads to sparse models, as some coefficients become exactly zero"
Data Preparation,Regularization,ElasticNet,Approach which combines L1 and L2 Regularization.
Data Preparation,Operational Definition,State,"State represents the current condition of an entity at a specific point in time. It answers the question “Where is this entity right now?” and reflects the most recent observed values of relevant measures. State is essential for anchoring decisions in the present but is insufficient on its own without historical context. In modeling, State provides immediacy and scale but must be interpreted alongside other dimensions to avoid over-reacting to short-term fluctuations."
Data Preparation,Operational Definition,Dimension,"A Dimension is a conceptual axis of behavior or meaning that you believe exists in the real world and want your model to represent. It answers a behavioral or semantic question, not a technical one. Dimensions are stable over time, even as data sources, features, or models change (for example, we always need to understand Current State, and rate of change, even though both of what is being studied may change drastically). They are the why behind your features.
Ultimately, it is the question, What Behaviour Matters."
Data Preparation,Operational Definition,Parameter,"A Parameter is a tuning choice that controls how an implementation is calculated, without changing what it represents. Parameters affect sensitivity, smoothness, or scale, but not conceptual meaning. They are the knobs you turn during experimentation. Examples include Window length: 3M vs 6M vs 12M, Weighting scheme: equal vs exponential, Aggregation: mean vs median
Ultimately it is the questions, How do we compute it."
Machine Learning,General Principles,Machine Learning,"Using a process to enable computers to iteratively learn from the data and improve analysis, outcomes or understanding. Intersection of statistics, artificial intelligence and computer science. Machine's don't learn, they find optimal mathematical formulas based on the data it is presented. There is an assumption that this data set is both representative of other data sets,  and possess similiar statistical distributions', You can argue this is not learning, because slight variances can result in materially different responses and output, Term synonymous with machines doing tasks without explicitly being programmed. Building a statistical model, based on a dataset"
Machine Learning,Pipeline Stage,Model Summarization / Model Interpretability,"Model summarization and interpretability aim to explain how the model makes decisions. This may include feature importance, partial dependence plots, SHAP values, or rule extraction. Interpretability builds trust with stakeholders and supports debugging, governance, and compliance. It is especially critical in high-stakes or regulated domains."
Machine Learning,General Principles,Optimization,"Optimization is the process of finding the best possible solution to a problem by systematically adjusting inputs or decisions to maximize or minimize a defined objective, subject to given constraints. In machine learning and analytics, optimization involves selecting model parameters that minimize error or maximize performance according to a chosen loss function. Importantly, what is considered “best” depends entirely on how the objective and constraints are defined."
Mathematics,Concept,Normality,Residuals should be normally distributed.
Mathematics,Theorem,Best Linear Unbiased Estimator,"The Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) is an estimation method in statistics that produces parameter estimates that are linear in the observed data, unbiased, and have the smallest possible variance among all such estimators. It originates from the Gauss–Markov theorem, developed in the early 19th century in the context of least squares and error theory. Its importance lies in providing a theoretical benchmark: under specific assumptions about error structure, no other linear unbiased estimator can be more precise. In practice, BLUE underpins ordinary and generalized least squares, and is widely applied in econometrics, engineering, and data science when modeling relationships with correlated or heteroskedastic errors"

Mathematics,Operational Definition,Function,"A function is a direct mathematical mapping: given an input, it deterministically produces an output. There is: no memory, no iteration, no learning history."
Mathematics,Operational Definition,Constraint,"A constraint is something that restricts or penalizes the solution space. It does not: directly compute outputs, directly update parameters.  Instead, it: limits what solutions are allowed nudges learning toward simplicity or stability"
Mathematics,Theorm,Algorithm,"An algorithm is a procedure that unfolds over time and depends on: previous states, iteration history and accumulated information."
Modelling,Model Architecture,Autoregressive,"Autoregressive models generate outputs one step at a time, where each prediction depends on the previously generated outputs. This sequential dependency allows the model to capture context and coherence, making it powerful for tasks like language modeling and time-series forecasting. However, because predictions are made step by step, autoregressive methods can be slower at inference compared to parallel approaches."
Modelling,Theorm,Curse of Dimensionality,"As dimensionality grows, data points become increasingly sparse, distances lose meaning, and models require exponentially more data to learn reliable patterns. This makes learning, generalization, and computation more difficult, often degrading model performance rather than improving it. In high-dimensional spaces, the optimization landscape also becomes far more complex, with many local minima and saddle points, making it harder to identify or converge toward a meaningful global minimum."

Validation,Procedure,K Fold Cross Validation,"Application of Cross Validation. Method for increasing ability to generlize results by segregating Training Data into K folds, such that the model never predicts on data it has seen. As an example, if Folds = 10 and x=100, each of the iterations would hold out 10 examples (such that all examples were held out in a iteration) and when the data was held out the model would predict. To reiterate, it helps with generalization, it does not increase performance, does not average and does not boost. It does materially increase training time. Primarily useful when data limitation exist, you're early on in development and want to prevent leakage or get cursory results. Also can provide a truer indication of performance based Metrics."
