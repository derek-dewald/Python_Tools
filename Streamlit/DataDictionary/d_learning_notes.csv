Machine Learning,Definition,Area Under the Curve,"AUC (Area Under the Curve) measures a model’s ability to distinguish between classes by summarizing the performance of the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve. It represents the probability that the model ranks a randomly chosen positive example higher than a randomly chosen negative one. AUC ranges from 0.5 (no better than chance) to 1.0 (perfect separation), with higher values indicating better classification performance.
AUC is primarily a binary classification metric, so when using against a multivariate challenge must determine how to score, OVR, OVO. One Vs Rest, One vs One. Using MNist as an example, OVR evaluates 10 0 vs (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), 1 vs () ... etc, Where OVO measures 45 0 Vs 1, 0 vs 2, etc..",0.0,0.0,
Machine Learning,Definition,Autoregressive,"Autoregressive models generate outputs one step at a time, where each prediction depends on the previously generated outputs. This sequential dependency allows the model to capture context and coherence, making it powerful for tasks like language modeling and time-series forecasting. However, because predictions are made step by step, autoregressive methods can be slower at inference compared to parallel approaches.",0.0,0.0,
Machine Learning,Definition,Bias,"Bias refers to the systematic error in a model that causes it to consistently deviate from the true value or correct predictions. It occurs when an algorithm makes incorrect assumptions or omissions about the data, leading to errors.
High Bias (Underfitting): The model is too simple and cannot capture patterns. 
Low Bias, High Variance (Overfitting). The model memorizes the data but does not generalize.",0.0,0.0,
Machine Learning,Definition,Bias - Variance Trade Off,"The bias-variance trade-off is a key concept in machine learning that highlights the balance between two sources of error: bias and variance, tuning the relationship between a model's complexity, the accuracy of its predictions, and how well it can make predictions on previously unseen data that were not used to train the model The challenge is to find a model that strikes the right balance between bias and variance, as reducing one typically increases the other. The ultimate goal is to minimize the total error, which is the sum of bias error, variance error, and irreducible noise inherent in the data. Achieving this balance ensures the model generalizes well to new, unseen data, avoiding both underfitting and overfitting. More Data vs More Data Science - Bias vs Variance 
It can often be explained by the Trade-Off (Bias - Data Scientist, Variance - Data), where to invest.

In general, as we increase the number of tunable parameters in a model, it becomes more flexible, and can better fit a training data set. It is said to have lower error, or bias. However, for more flexible models, there will tend to be greater variance to the model fit each time we take a set of samples to create a new training data set. It is said that there is greater variance in the model's estimated parameters.High-variance learning methods may be able to represent their training set well but are at risk of overfitting to noisy or unrepresentative training data. In contrast, algorithms with high bias typically produce simpler models that may fail to capture important regularities (i.e. underfit) in the data.",0.0,0.0,
Machine Learning,Definition,Cross Validation,"Model evaluation technique used to assess how well a model generalizes to unseen data by repeatedly splitting the dataset into training and validation subsets.

This approach helps detect overfitting and supports more robust model selection",0.0,0.0,
Machine Learning,Definition,Curse of Dimensionality,"As dimensionality grows, data points become increasingly sparse, distances lose meaning, and models require exponentially more data to learn reliable patterns.

Machine Learning,Definition,Deep Learning,"Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layer neural networks to automatically learn hierarchical representations from data, reducing the need for manual feature engineering. By stacking simple processing units called layers—each acting as a filter that transforms inputs into higher-level representations—deep learning models can capture complex patterns through composition. Early challenges such as vanishing gradients, where learning signals faded through many layers, were largely addressed through improved activation functions, optimization methods, and weight initialization strategies.

Machine Learning,Definition,Variance,"Variance refers to errors caused by models that are too sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data, often resulting in overfitting. High-variance models are overly flexible, capturing noise as if it were meaningful patterns. A model with many degrees of freedom (such as a high-degree polynomial model) is likely to have high variance and thus overfit the training data. As an example, if you created a model of How Predicting Housing Prices in 1 Neighbourhood would work and applied it to different neighbourhoods, if your model was simple, it wouldn’t work well anywhere and thus would be Wrong, but consistently-ish wrong. If your model was Good, it would work similarly well every well. If you model was overfit, it would work really well in 1 place, not so well elsewhere.

Machine Learning,Model,Algorithm,"Gradient Descent: Widely used optimization algorithm in machine learning, particularly for training models like neural networks. Its primary goal is to minimize a loss function, which measures the error between the model's predictions and the actual outcomes, by iteratively adjusting the model’s parameters.

Traditional Gradient Descent vs. Stochastic Gradient Descent
In Batch Gradient Descent, the algorithm computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model’s parameters using the entire dataset before updating the parameters. While this approach provides a precise update direction, it is computationally expensive and slow for large datasets since it requires processing all data points in each iteration.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) addresses this issue by approximating the gradient. Instead of computing gradients over the full dataset, SGD updates the model’s parameters using just a single data point at each step. This significantly reduces computational cost per iteration, making the algorithm much faster. However, since updates are based on a single random sample, they introduce high variance (noise), causing fluctuations that may prevent smooth convergence.
Mini-Batch Gradient Descent: To balance efficiency and stability, a common alternative is Mini-Batch Gradient Descent. Instead of using the full dataset (Batch Gradient Descent) or a single data point (SGD), Mini-Batch Gradient Descent computes updates using a small batch of randomly selected data points (e.g., 32, 64, or 128 samples per batch). This approach: Reduces noise compared to SGD while still being computationally efficient. 
Leverages vectorized operations for faster computation using modern hardware (e.g., GPUs).
Smooths out updates while still allowing some stochasticity to escape local minima.
Benefits & Trade-offs of SGD
Faster updates: Each iteration is computationally cheaper than full-batch gradient descent.
Better exploration: The randomness in updates helps escape local minima.
Higher variance: The noisier updates may lead to less stable convergence, requiring techniques like learning rate decay or momentum to improve performance.
Slower convergence: Since updates are less precise, SGD may take longer to reach the optimal solution.
Conclusion
SGD, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, and Batch Gradient Descent each offer different trade-offs in terms of speed, stability, and computational efficiency. In practice, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent is the most commonly used approach for deep learning, as it provides a balance between computational efficiency and convergence stability.",0.0,6.0,46.0
