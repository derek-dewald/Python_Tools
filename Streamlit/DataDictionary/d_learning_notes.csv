Machine Learning,Definition,Machine Learning,"Using a process to enable computers to iteratively learn from the data and improve analysis, outcomes or understanding. Intersection of statistics, artificial intelligence and computer science. Machine's don't learn, they find optimal mathematical formulas based on the data it is presented. There is an assumption that this data set is both representative of other data sets,  and possess similiar statistical distributions', You can argue this is not learning, because slight variances can result in materially different responses and output, Term synonymous with machines doing tasks without explicitly being programmed. Building a statistical model, based on a dataset"
Machine Learning,Distinct Types of ML,Supervised Learning,"Supervised learning trains a model using labeled data, where the correct answer is known in advance. The model learns a mapping from inputs to outputs by minimizing the difference between its predictions and the true labels. Common examples include classification and regression problems."
Machine Learning,Distinct Types of ML,Unsupervised Learning,"Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data and aims to discover hidden patterns or structure. The model groups, compresses, or summarizes the data without being told what the correct outcome is. Typical use cases include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection."
Machine Learning,Distinct Types of ML,Semisupervised Learning,Semi-supervised learning combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data to improve learning performance. The model leverages the structure in the unlabeled data to generalize better than supervised learning alone. This approach is useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.
Machine Learning,Distinct Types of ML,Reinforcement Learning,"Reinforcement learning trains an agent to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties. The agent learns a policy that maximizes cumulative reward over time through trial and error. It is commonly used in robotics, game playing, and control systems."
Machine Learning,Optimization,Optimization,"Optimization is the process of finding the best possible solution to a problem by systematically adjusting inputs or decisions to maximize or minimize a defined objective, subject to given constraints. In machine learning and analytics, optimization involves selecting model parameters that minimize error or maximize performance according to a chosen loss function. Importantly, what is considered “best” depends entirely on how the objective and constraints are defined."
Machine Learning,Optimization,Goal,"What are you attempting to maximize, Training Performance, or ability to Generalize.  Strive to avoid overfitting, maximize ability to Generalize."
Machine Learning,Optimization,Approach,Curse of Dimensionality
Machine Learning,Optimization,Important to Remember,"Must remember what the Model is actually trying to solve and the approach that it is taking. As an example, when Regularization is imporant, when it is not."
Machine Learning,Optimization,Important to Remember,"Models will cheat and can solve problems which appear to be optimal, but they might not be solving what you expect or require, they might be finding patterns in the data which you do not see."
Machine Learning,Optimization,Important to Remember,"An Example of this would a classification model with Wolves and Dogs,  many wolf photos happened to be taken in snowy environments, while dog photos were often taken indoors or on grass. The model learned to detect snow, not animals."

Machine Learning,Evaluation,Stratified Cross Validation,"Splitting Data into statistically represented folds. If you can assume data is IID, then generally would not be required or benefitical, however it might be determined necessary and thus can be considered."
Machine Learning,Evaluation,Confusion Matrix,
Machine Learning,Evaluation,Accuracy,"Generally not a preferred metric, Especially as it relates to Balance Datasets, where picking the underrepresented class is always a challenge."

Machine Learning,Deep Learning,Evolution,"Historical Issue of gradient propogration where signal would fade through the layers was solved through, better activation functions, optimization schemes and weight initializing."
Machine Learning,Deep Learning,Framework,"Core building block is the layer, a filter which creates a representation, can chain simple layers into a complex one. "
Machine Learning,Deep Learning,Model,"Model starts with determining the number of layers, type of connections, and activation functions. Once model is defined, to comile need to determine, Optimizer, Loss Function and Metric."
Machine Learning,Lesson Learnt,Always Have a Simple Baseline,"Need a reference to test performance of the model. If dataset is imbalanced, have simple guess. If temperature, guess trailing average, etc, find something simple, often very difficutl to beat, and juice might not be worth the squeeze."
Machine Learning,Downside,Simplicity Not Assumed,"ML can't look naively for a simple common sense solution. Unless feature engineered or hard coded, model will always just plug forward. "
