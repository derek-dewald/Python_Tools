Behavioural Economics,Consideration,What does a metric actually represent?,"In February 2018, there were fourteen murders in New York City, but fifteen in London.[1] But what should we conclude? Nothing. We should conclude nothing because that pair of numbers alone tells us very little. If we want to understand what’s happening, we need to step back and take in a broader perspective. Here are a few facts worth knowing about murders in London and New York. London had 184 murders in 1990, while New York suffered 2,262—more than ten times as many. It’s with that image in mind of New York as a murderous place that Londoners are alarmed at the idea that they might have become as rotten as the Big Apple. But London’s murder rate has fallen, not risen, since 1990. In 2017, there were 130 murders in London, including ten people killed in terrorist attacks. London was safe in 1990 and it’s a little bit safer today. As for New York, murders fell to 292 in 2017. That means New York is still more dangerous than London, but much, much safer than in 1990."
Behavioural Economics,Consideration,How to Efficiently Guestimate,"""The population of the United States is 325 million. The population of the United Kingdom is 65 million. The population of the world is 7.5 billion. Name any particular age (under the age of sixty). There are about 800,000 people of that age in the UK. If a policy involves all three-year-olds, for example, there are 800,000 of them. In the United States, there are about 4 million people of any particular age (under the age of sixty). Distance around the Earth: 40,000 kilometers, or 25,000 miles. It varies depending on whether you go around the poles or around the equator, but not much. The drive from Boston to Seattle: 3,000 miles.

Length of a bed: 2 meters (or 7 feet). As Elliott points out, this helps you visualize the size of a room: How many beds is that? The gross domestic product of the United States: about $20 trillion (or $20,000 billion). It’s a lot of walls, if that’s really how you want to spend it. 100,000 words: the length of a medium-size novel. 1,454 feet: the height of the Empire State Building to its tip. (It’s also about 102 stories.)"""

Tooling,TBD,TBD,"Streamlit and Gradio are both Python frameworks for building web interfaces, but they serve different purposes. Streamlit is designed for creating interactive data applications and dashboards, offering strong support for state, layouts, and multi-step analytical workflows. Gradio is optimized for quickly exposing machine-learning models through simple, function-based interfaces, making it ideal for demos and model inference. Streamlit emphasizes ongoing use and exploration by analysts or internal teams, while Gradio emphasizes ease of sharing and rapid experimentation. In practice, Streamlit is better suited for complex analytics tools, whereas Gradio excels at lightweight model demonstration interfaces."
Tooling,TBD,TBD,"LangChain and LlamaIndex are complementary but focus on different layers of LLM applications. LangChain is an orchestration framework, designed to manage prompts, chains, agents, tools, and multi-step workflows involving LLMs. LlamaIndex focuses on the data layer, providing utilities to ingest, index, and retrieve structured and unstructured data for use with LLMs. In practice, LlamaIndex is often used to prepare and query data, while LangChain coordinates how the LLM reasons, calls tools, and responds. Many real-world systems use LlamaIndex for retrieval and LangChain to orchestrate the overall application flow."
Tooling,TBD,TBD,"LangChain does not have a single, all-encompassing vector store class, and typically relies on integrations with external libraries to integrate a vector database. The only commonly used vector store defined within the LangChain core library is the InMemoryVectorStore which stores vectors in memory. LlamaIndex provides a powerful VectorStoreIndex class that stores vectors in memory by default but can be integrated with full-fledged vector databases such as Chroma DB or Faiss. Thus, LlamaIndex's VectorStoreIndex class ensures ease of use because the vector store backend can be swapped out without changing any of the downstream code."
