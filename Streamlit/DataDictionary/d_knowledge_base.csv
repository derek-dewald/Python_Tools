ML Project,Process Step,Goal Setting,"Establish a clear, concise and explicit goal for the project. While ideally the goal will be defined in terms of Key Performance Indicators, when the work is truly explorative or borne in the spirt of true experiementation, it is still critical to establish guardrails, and get everyone to agree. Additional, there needs to be a deliverable, again even if vague, a deliverable needs to be agreed upon and structured in some format to insure that all parties have appropriately managed expectations.

There should be no more than 3 Goals (Flexible), the goals should be SMART and explicitly acknowledged and supported by the "
ML Project,Process Step,Problem Definition,"A Clear, Concise and explicit definition of the problem at hand, or a ""Problem Statement"". A problem statement should be simple, and include at a minimum 5 items; a 1) current state analysis, 2) root cause assessment, 3) historical overview of what has been done, 4) metrics quantifying the current state (baseline), and 5) metrics quantifying (or providing insight into the desired state). 

Proceed with extreme caution where the problem statement is incomplete, or ill-stated, as this is likely indicative that the problem is not truly understood or at a minimum defined. Where this is the case, the project will be at extreme risk the likelihood of change to project purpose, scope or priority likely."
ML Project,Process Step,Data Collection,"Data collection involves identifying, sourcing, and acquiring the datasets required to solve the defined problem. This may include internal databases, APIs, logs, third-party data, or manually collected data. Key considerations include data availability, coverage, granularity, freshness, and legal or privacy constraints. The quality and relevance of collected data fundamentally limit the ceiling of model performance.

Need to understand the data available to solve a problem, insure that it's documented, understood and trusted. Need to identify, not only information which is available, but information which is not available and should be.  This should be explicitly documented, referenced constantly and readily available (Semantic and Functional Definition).
"
ML Project,Process Step,Data Preparation,"Data preparation focuses on cleaning and structuring raw data into a usable format for modeling. This includes handling missing values, correcting errors, standardizing formats, encoding categorical variables, and aligning labels with features. It also often involves train/validation/test splitting to prevent data leakage. This step is critical because most models assume clean, well-structured inputs and are highly sensitive to data issues.

Need to establish up a consistent, robust and repeatable data ingestion process, which starts at the outset of the project. Where the infrastructure is not immediately available, need to clearly document the journey.  Need to call out requirements, expectations and limitations, and where resources are necessary, they should be identified at this point. 

Where operational changes are necessary, or a prerequisite, need to understand how these will documented and escalated or addressed."
ML Project,Process Step,Exploratory Data Analysis,"Foundational step in ensuring the success of a machine learning model—and, by extension, the overall project. Its purpose is to confirm that the data is appropriately structured, consistent, and of sufficient quality to support reliable modeling.

While every dataset and project is unique, applying a consistent EDA approach helps reduce the laborious and time-consuming nature of data preparation. A structured process enables quicker identification of data issues, improves understanding of key variables and relationships, and creates a more stable foundation for subsequent modeling decisions. "
ML Project,Process Step,Feature Engineering,"Process of creating new input variables that better represent the underlying patterns in the data. It may include transformations (log, scaling), aggregations, interactions, temporal features, or domain-specific encodings. Effective feature engineering can significantly improve model performance even with simple algorithms. It embeds domain knowledge into the model and often provides more value than algorithmic complexity.  It is often one of the most impactful steps in the machine learning workflow."
ML Project,Process Step,Feature Selection,"Process of identifying and retaining the most relevant variables for model training while removing redundant, noisy, or irrelevant features. This helps reduce overfitting, improve model performance, and increase interpretability. Feature selection techniques may be statistical, model-based, or embedded within the learning algorithm. The goal is to create a simpler, more robust feature set that generalizes well to new data.

It is important to be in a position to Logically and Mathematically be in a position to defend inclusion and exclusion decisions. Although a highly technical step, it is critically important that stakeholders and partners are included and in references and terms which are appropriate for them."
ML Project,Process Step,Validation/ Model Selection,"The process of choosing the most appropriate algorithm or model type for a given problem and dataset. This decision is based on factors such as data size, feature structure, interpretability needs, computational constraints, and performance requirements. Multiple candidate models are often tested and compared using consistent evaluation methods. The objective is to identify the model that provides the best balance between accuracy, stability, and practical usability.

Similiar to the process of engagement and audit followed in Feature Selection, it is critically important that actions are documented, defensable and clearly and consistently articulated to stakeholders in a meaningful manner."
ML Project,Process Step,Training,"Process of fitting a machine learning model to data so it can learn the relationships between input features and the target variable. During training, the model adjusts its internal parameters to minimize a loss function. This step typically occurs on a designated training dataset. The quality of training directly affects the model’s ability to generalize to new, unseen data."
ML Project,Process Step,Hyperparameter Tuning,"Optimizing the configuration settings that control how a model learns, rather than the parameters learned during training. These settings, such as tree depth or regularization strength, can significantly influence model performance and stability. Tuning is typically done using methods like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization. The goal is to identify the hyperparameter combination that produces the best validation performance."
ML Project,Process Step,Model Evaluation,"Process of measuring how well a trained model performs using appropriate metrics and test data. This step assesses predictive accuracy, generalization, and robustness. Different metrics are used depending on the problem type, such as accuracy, F1 score, RMSE, or AUC. Evaluation ensures the model meets performance expectations before deployment, and results often determine whether a model is production-ready."
ML Project,Process Step,Validation,"Validation is the process of assessing model performance on data that was not used during training. It is used to tune hyperparameters, compare models, and detect overfitting. Common approaches include hold-out validation and cross-validation techniques. The purpose is to estimate how well the model will perform on unseen data."
ML Project,Process Step,Model Summarization / Model Interpretability,"Process of explaining how a model makes predictions and which features influence its decisions. This may involve feature importance, partial dependence plots, SHAP values, or simpler surrogate models. Interpretability helps stakeholders understand, trust, and validate the model’s behavior. It is especially important in regulated or high-impact decision environments."
ML Project,Process Step,Deployment,"Deployment is the process of integrating the trained model into a production environment where it can generate real-world predictions. This may involve APIs, batch pipelines, streaming systems, or embedded applications. Considerations include scalability, latency, reliability, and versioning. Deployment turns a model from an experiment into a usable product. The goal is to make the model usable and operational in real-world settings."
ML Project,Process Step,Monitoring,"Ongoing process of tracking model performance and data quality after deployment. It helps detect issues such as data drift, concept drift, performance degradation, or system failures. Monitoring ensures the model continues to perform as expected over time. When problems are detected, retraining or model updates may be required."
ML Project,Process Step,"Bias, Fairness, and Ethics","This step examines whether the model produces systematically unfair or harmful outcomes across different groups. It includes analyzing data representation, outcome disparities, and unintended correlations. Ethical considerations may involve transparency, consent, explainability, and regulatory compliance. Addressing bias and fairness is essential for responsible, trustworthy, and legally compliant ML systems."
Goal Setting,Process Step,Specific,"Describes what will be accomplished and what success will look like. It answers the questions: What will I do? Who is involved? What area am I focusing on? The more precise the goal, the easier it is to plan actions and stay focused."
Goal Setting,Process Step,Measurable,"Includes a clear way to track progress or determine success. This may involve numbers, percentages, milestones, deliverables, or observable outcomes. Measurement ensures accountability and helps you know when the goal has been achieved."
Goal Setting,Process Step,Achievable,"Realistic given available time, resources, skills, and competing priorities. It should stretch performance but still be possible to accomplish with focused effort. Setting achievable goals helps maintain motivation and builds confidence through success."
Goal Setting,Process Step,Relevant,"Aligns with broader priorities, such as team objectives, organizational strategy, or personal development plans. It should contribute meaningful value rather than being an isolated or low-impact task. Relevance ensures time and energy are spent on what matters most."
Goal Setting,Process Step,Time Bound,"Includes a clear deadline or timeframe for completion. This creates urgency, supports planning, and prevents goals from being postponed indefinitely. Defined timelines also make it easier to monitor progress and adjust actions if needed."
Goal Setting,Process Step,Requirement,"Are Goals Documented. Are the Smart.
If not, what does this imply and how do we proceed forward while mitigating risk."
Problem Definition,Process Step,Desired State Metrics,"Describe the target outcomes or performance levels that define success. They show what improvement looks like in measurable terms and help guide priorities and actions. This is important because clear targets create alignment, focus efforts, and allow teams to track progress toward meaningful results."
Problem Definition,Process Step,Current State Analysis,"Describes how the process, system, or situation is functioning today. It provides a factual, objective picture of what is happening, without assumptions or solutions. This is important because it ensures everyone has a shared understanding of reality before trying to fix the problem."
Problem Definition,Process Step,Root Cause Assessment,"Identifies the underlying reasons why the problem exists. Rather than focusing on symptoms, it explores the fundamental drivers using methods such as the “5 Whys” or cause-and-effect analysis. This is important because addressing root causes leads to sustainable improvements, while only treating symptoms often results in recurring issues."
Problem Definition,Process Step,Historical Overview,"Summarizes what actions, initiatives, or attempts have already been made to address the problem. It explains what was tried, what worked, and what did not. This is important because it prevents repeating past mistakes and helps build on lessons learned."
Problem Definition,Process Step,Baseline Metrics (Current State),"Quantify the current state of the problem using measurable data such as performance indicators, volumes, timelines, or quality measures. These metrics provide an objective reference point for understanding the scope and impact of the issue. This is important because improvement cannot be measured without a clear starting baseline."
Problem Definition,Process Step,Requirement,"Attempt to explicitly define outcomes and relevant KPIs for those outcomes. Where that can not happen, it is important to understand why that can not happen. What is happening if we dont have and follow metrics. IE. The Account Opening Process is not effiicient and needs to improve, The Internet Banking Experience is poor, and does not attract customers. How do you monitor this, how can you define this, how can you prove this,  how do you expect this to change and measure that change.

How will the project and efforts be measured where success can not be objectively measured? How will resources be allocated when it remains unclear what benefit or risk exists."
Problem Definition,Process Step,Requirement,"Must be careful at how problem is defined. Is it defined in the context of the already identifed solution, has it been validated and is the problem distinct from the analysis and potential solution, or have we leaked into the process."
Problem Definition,Process Step,Consideration,"How Invested are stakeholders in defining the problem? What is their view of the process/ project, how invested, interested and engaged are they. What are their personal goals and motivation, speed, accuracy, validation of ideology?"
Problem Definition,Process Step,Consideration,"Proceed with extreme caution where the problem statement is incomplete, or ill-stated, as this is likely indicative that the problem is not truly understood or at a minimum defined. Where this is the case, the project will be at extreme risk and the likelihood of not meeting expectations, frustration, or material change to purpose, scope or priority is inevitable."
Data Collection,Process Step,Requirement,"What consessions have we made due to a lack of data availability, and how are those going to undermine the work we plan on doing. "
Data Collection,Process Step,Requirement,"Who is the Data Steward, are they involved, and operationally do we have integrity, consistency and availability to include?"
Data Collection,Process Step,Requirement,"Review Semantic and Functional Definitions, ensuring there is sufficient and appropriate coverage. Testing and decisioning to occur during Feature Selection."
Data Preparation,Definition,Baseline,"Baseline represents the typical or expected behavior of an entity over a meaningful historical period. It answers the question “What is normal for this entity?” and provides context against which current state and changes can be interpreted. Baseline is conceptually stable even when its numeric value evolves, allowing models to distinguish structural differences between entities from temporary deviations. In modeling, Baseline is often foundational for defining identity and long-term segmentation."
Data Preparation,Definition,Dimension,"A Dimension is a conceptual axis of behavior or meaning that you believe exists in the real world and want your model to represent. It answers a behavioral or semantic question, not a technical one. Dimensions are stable over time, even as data sources, features, or models change (for example, we always need to understand Current State, and rate of change, even though both of what is being studied may change drastically). They are the why behind your features.
Ultimately, it is the question, What Behaviour Matters."
Data Preparation,Definition,Implementation,"An Implementation is a specific measurable representation of a dimension, constructed from available data. It answers the question: “How do we observe this dimension in practice?” Implementations can change as data improves, but they should always map clearly back to a single dimension. Examples include; 6-month rolling average balance, 12-month median transaction value, Seasonally adjusted mean.
Ultimately it is the question, How do we measure it."
Data Preparation,Definition,Momentum,"Momentum represents the direction and rate of change in behavior over time. It answers the question “Is this entity increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable?” and captures transitional dynamics that are not visible from state or baseline alone. Momentum is critical for detecting emerging trends, shifts in behavior, and potential future movement between segments. In modeling, Momentum often explains why change is occurring rather than what the current condition is."
Data Preparation,Definition,Parameter,"A Parameter is a tuning choice that controls how an implementation is calculated, without changing what it represents. Parameters affect sensitivity, smoothness, or scale, but not conceptual meaning. They are the knobs you turn during experimentation. Examples include Window length: 3M vs 6M vs 12M, Weighting scheme: equal vs exponential, Aggregation: mean vs median
Ultimately it is the questions, How do we compute it."
Data Preparation,Definition,Volatility,"Volatility represents the consistency or variability of behavior over time. It answers the question “How stable or predictable is this entity’s behavior?” and distinguishes steady patterns from irregular or erratic ones. Volatility provides important diagnostic context, helping differentiate sustained change from noise or one-off events. In modeling, Volatility is typically explanatory or risk-related rather than defining core identity."
Data Preparation,Definition,Semantic Type,"Influenced by the literal definition of semantic: the meaning or  nature of a variable, describes what kind of real-world concept a variable represents, independent of any specific model. It classifies data based on meaning—such as whether a variable reflects behaviour (actions over time), structure (relatively stable state or capacity), or context (situational or explanatory attributes). Definition helps to classify the variable for inclusion, or exclusion of a model."
Data Preparation,Definition,Functional Role,"Describes how a variable is used within a specific model or modeling process, rather than what it represents conceptually. It classifies variables based on whether they actively shape the model (core), help interpret results (descriptive), or evaluate model quality and stability (diagnostic). For example, POS Transaction 6-Month Average may be a core variable that defines clusters, while Assignment Margin is diagnostic because it evaluates how confidently members are assigned. Classifying functional role is critical in ML modeling—especially in unsupervised learning—because it makes modeling assumptions explicit, prevents unintended variables from shaping outcomes, and enables controlled, explainable model evolution."
Data Preparation,Process Step,Requirement,"Define strategies around Imputation, Deletion, Standardization."
Data Preparation,Process Step,Requirement,"Model Pipleine, including training, testing and validation strategies."
Data Preparation,Regularization,ElasticNet,Approach which combines L1 and L2 Regularization.
Data Preparation,Regularization,Lasso,"Technique used to prevent overfitting by adding penalty term to loss function. Adds the absolute values of the coefficients as a penalty term. This leads to sparse models, as some coefficients become exactly zero"
Data Preparation,Regularization,Ridge,"Technique used to prevent overfitting by adding penalty term to loss function. Adds the squared values of the coefficients as a penalty term. This incrases the cost of larger parameters, encouraging the model to distribute parameters waiting This shrinks the coefficients but does not eliminate them."
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,State,"State represents the current condition of an entity at a specific point in time. It answers the question “Where is this entity right now?” and reflects the most recent observed values of relevant measures, frequency, balances, etc. State is essential for anchoring decisions in the present but is insufficient on its own without historical context. In modeling, State provides immediacy and scale but must be interpreted alongside other dimensions to avoid over-reacting to short-term fluctuations. Examples Include: Current Deposit Balance, Current Month POS TXN Count, Number of Active Accounts."
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Descriptive,"Descriptive represents summarized or smoothed representations of an entity’s behavior over a defined historical window. It answers the question “What does this entity typically look like?” by reducing short-term noise and highlighting central tendency or typical patterns across time. Descriptive measures provide stability and interpretability by contextualizing current behavior within a broader historical baseline. In modeling, Descriptive variables help prevent over-reaction to transient spikes or dips but must be carefully managed to avoid redundancy with State measures. Examples include Avg Balances, Maximums over an extended period of time."
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Diagnostic,"Diagnostic represents measures of directionality, momentum, or variability in an entity’s behavior over time. It answers the question “How is this entity changing?” by capturing growth, decline, volatility, or acceleration relative to prior periods. Diagnostic measures are essential for understanding trajectory, early warning signals, and emerging shifts that may not yet be visible in current state alone. In modeling, Diagnostic variables enhance interpretability and foresight but should be used cautiously, as excessive reliance can introduce instability and reduce cluster persistence. Diagnostic can be broken into 4 Categories, Trend, Momentum, Change and Volatility."
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Structural,"Structural represents relatively stable attributes that describe how an entity is configured within the system rather than how it behaves at a given moment. It answers the question “What is the entity’s structural position?” by reflecting enduring characteristics such as product holdings, account composition, or long-term balances. Structural measures anchor and constrain behavior by defining capacity, access, and configuration. In modeling, Structural variables provide important context but should be included sparingly to avoid overwhelming activity-based signals or unintentionally clustering entities by size rather than behavior. Product Count, Product Flags, Tenure."
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Contextual,"Contextual represents external or situational factors that influence behavior but are not behaviors themselves. It answers the question “What conditions surround this entity?” by capturing environmental, geographic, policy, or situational elements that shape observed actions. Contextual measures help explain why similar entities may behave differently under different circumstances. In modeling, Contextual variables are generally inappropriate as primary drivers of similarity but are critical for interpretation, validation, and responsible application of results. Examples include, Regional Indicator, Interest Rate Macro Flags, Employement Type)"
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Demographic,"Demographic represents intrinsic attributes of an entity that change infrequently and describe who the entity is rather than what it does. It answers the question “Who is this entity?” by capturing characteristics such as age, household composition, or other identity-level descriptors. Demographic measures provide essential interpretive context and support equity-aware analysis but do not directly represent behavior. In modeling, Demographic variables are typically excluded from defining similarity to avoid embedding bias or non-actionable distinctions, and are instead used for post-hoc analysis, monitoring, and policy alignment. Examples inlcude, Member Age Band, Language Preferences, Postal Code, Household Parameters, etc."
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Constraint,"Constraint represents limitations or enabling conditions that bound an entity’s range of possible behavior. It answers the question “What limits or enables this entity’s choices?” by approximating capacity, dependency, or stress through proxy measures such as income concentration or balance volatility. Constraint measures help distinguish inability from preference. In modeling, Constraint variables are best used diagnostically to interpret cluster composition rather than to define cluster membership."
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Constraint: Capacity,"Constraints which represent the fundamental economic or operational limits that bound an entity’s feasible range of actions, regardless of intent or preference. They are critical for distinguishing observed behavior from what is realistically possible, helping avoid misinterpretation of low activity as disinterest rather than limitation. In modeling, capacity constraints provide guardrails for ethical interpretation and prevent over-attribution of agency where structural limits exist. They are best used diagnostically to contextualize clusters and inform suitability, risk, and support decisions.

Examples; Debt service ratio (estimated obligations ÷ inflows), Credit utilization rate, Liquidity coverage ratio (liquid balances ÷ monthly outflows)"
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Constraint: Stability & Fragility,"Constraints which capture the reliability and predictability of an entity’s financial or behavioral foundation rather than its current level or direction. They are important because volatility, dependency, or irregularity can severely limit planning ability and resilience even when averages appear healthy. These constraints help explain why entities with similar states behave differently under stress or change. In modeling, they support early risk identification and responsible interpretation without driving cluster formation.

Examples; Balance volatility index, Income concentration ratio, Irregular inflow variability score"
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Constraint: Access & Configuration,"Constraints which reflect limitations imposed by system setup, product availability, or channel enablement rather than by the entity’s choices. They are important because behavior cannot be meaningfully interpreted without understanding what options are actually available. These constraints help distinguish exclusion or friction from deliberate disengagement. In modeling, they ensure clusters are interpreted in light of opportunity sets rather than assumed preferences.

Examples; Lack of revolving credit access flag, Digital banking enablement indicator, Funds locked in restricted or term products ratio"
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Constraint: Stress & Load,"Constraints which represent sustained pressure that restricts flexibility and increases vulnerability, even if short-term indicators appear stable. They are important for identifying entities operating near or beyond their functional limits, where small shocks can lead to outsized effects. These constraints help explain brittle or reactive behaviors that are not captured by state alone. In modeling, they support responsible application by highlighting latent risk without over-weighting transient fluctuations.

Examples: Frequency of negative net cash-flow periods, Overdraft reliance rate, Minimum balance breach frequency"
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Constraint: Time & Commitment,"Constraints which capture obligations that reduce an entity’s degrees of freedom over a defined horizon, independent of current behavior. They are important because long-term commitments can materially limit adaptability, even when present conditions seem favorable. These constraints help explain inertia, delayed responses, or resistance to change in observed behavior. In modeling, they provide critical context for interpreting persistence and transition dynamics across clusters. 

Examples. Fixed commitment load (recurring debits ÷ outflows), Long-term product commitment score, Contractual tenure-weighted obligation index"
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Diagnostic - Change,"Measures the difference in a value between two defined points in time. It answers the question “How much did this metric increase or decrease?” by comparing a current period to a prior baseline. Change captures short-term movement and is often the first signal of emerging behavior. In modeling, Change variables are useful for detecting early shifts but can be noisy if used without context.
Examples: Month-over-month change in total deposits, Change in transaction count compared to last month, Increase or decrease in average account balance since prior period"
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Diagnostic - Trend,"Describes the overall direction and pattern of change across multiple time periods rather than a single comparison. It answers “Is this behavior generally increasing, decreasing, or stable over time?” by smoothing short-term fluctuations. Trends provide insight into sustained behavioral movement and are more stable than point-in-time changes. In modeling, Trend variables help distinguish temporary spikes from meaningful trajectories.

Examples: 6-month rolling trend in payroll deposits, Slope of average monthly balance over the past year, Directional trend in debit transaction volume"
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Diagnostic - Volatility,"Measures how variable or inconsistent a metric is over time. It answers “How stable is this behavior?” by capturing dispersion, fluctuation, or unpredictability around a typical value. High volatility often indicates irregular engagement or financial instability, while low volatility suggests consistent behavior. In modeling, Volatility variables can be strong predictors but must be interpreted carefully to avoid overreacting to noise.

Examples: Standard deviation of monthly deposits over 6 months, Variability in transaction counts across recent periods, Fluctuation in balance levels month to month"
Data Preparation,Semantic Type,Diagnostic - Momentum,"Measures the rate and acceleration of change rather than the direction alone. It answers “Is this behavior changing faster or slowing down?” by assessing whether growth or decline is intensifying. Momentum highlights inflection points that may not yet be visible in overall trend. In modeling, Momentum variables are powerful early-warning indicators but can introduce instability if overused. It is effectively the second derivative, so the change of the change.

Examples;  Acceleration in deposit growth over consecutive months, Increasing rate of decline in account balances, Speed of increase in digital transaction adoption"
Data Preparation,Functional Role,Core Variables,"Primary drivers of similarity and distance in cluster formation. They directly define the behavioral dimensions the segmentation is intended to capture, and removing them would materially change cluster structure or archetype meaning. Core variables are included in distance calculations and must remain stable across model iterations to preserve interpretability. Core variables are most often State or Descriptive behavioral measures, and should be limited in number."
Data Preparation,Functional Role,Supporting,"Contribute to cluster separation, stability, or boundary refinement but do not independently define cluster identity. They may influence distance calculations or be used in secondary weighting, but clusters should remain interpretable without them. Supporting variables help smooth transitions, reduce ambiguity, or capture secondary behavior patterns. Supporting variables can include State, Descriptive, Structural, or Diagnostic measures."
Data Preparation,Functional Role,Explanatory,"Not used in cluster formation or distance calculations. They provide interpretive context after clusters are formed, helping explain why clusters look the way they do rather than how they were created. These variables are often used for labeling, storytelling, validation, or governance review. Explanatory variables commonly include Structural, Contextual, or Demographic attributes."
Data Preparation,Functional Role,Monitoring,"Variables used to track outcomes, drift, or post-engagement effects over time. Monitoring variables are excluded from clustering inputs to avoid leakage but are essential for evaluating stability and impact."

Model Evaluation,Process Step,Requirement,Check for overfitting by comparing training and test results. Identifies models that may not perform well in production.
Model Evaluation,Feature Selection,Area Under the Curve,"AUC (Area Under the Curve) measures a model’s ability to distinguish between classes by summarizing the performance of the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve. It represents the probability that the model ranks a randomly chosen positive example higher than a randomly chosen negative one. AUC ranges from 0.5 (no better than chance) to 1.0 (perfect separation), with higher values indicating better classification performance.
AUC is primarily a binary classification metric, so when using against a multivariate challenge must determine how to score, OVR, OVO. One Vs Rest, One vs One. Using MNist as an example, OVR evaluates 10 0 vs (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), 1 vs () ... etc, Where OVO measures 45 0 Vs 1, 0 vs 2, etc.."
Model Evaluation,Feature Selection,Bias,"Bias refers to the systematic error in a model that causes it to consistently deviate from the true value or correct predictions. It occurs when an algorithm makes incorrect assumptions or omissions about the data, leading to errors.
High Bias (Underfitting): The model is too simple and cannot capture patterns. 
Low Bias, High Variance (Overfitting). The model memorizes the data but does not generalize."
Model Evaluation,Feature Selection,Bias - Variance Trade Off,"The bias-variance trade-off is a key concept in machine learning that highlights the balance between two sources of error: bias and variance, tuning the relationship between a model's complexity, the accuracy of its predictions, and how well it can make predictions on previously unseen data that were not used to train the model The challenge is to find a model that strikes the right balance between bias and variance, as reducing one typically increases the other. The ultimate goal is to minimize the total error, which is the sum of bias error, variance error, and irreducible noise inherent in the data. Achieving this balance ensures the model generalizes well to new, unseen data, avoiding both underfitting and overfitting. More Data vs More Data Science - Bias vs Variance 
It can often be explained by the Trade-Off (Bias - Data Scientist, Variance - Data), where to invest.

In general, as we increase the number of tunable parameters in a model, it becomes more flexible, and can better fit a training data set. It is said to have lower error, or bias. However, for more flexible models, there will tend to be greater variance to the model fit each time we take a set of samples to create a new training data set. It is said that there is greater variance in the model's estimated parameters.High-variance learning methods may be able to represent their training set well but are at risk of overfitting to noisy or unrepresentative training data. In contrast, algorithms with high bias typically produce simpler models that may fail to capture important regularities (i.e. underfit) in the data."
Model Evaluation,Feature Selection,Variance,"Variance refers to errors caused by models that are too sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data, often resulting in overfitting. High-variance models are overly flexible, capturing noise as if it were meaningful patterns. A model with many degrees of freedom (such as a high-degree polynomial model) is likely to have high variance and thus overfit the training data. As an example, if you created a model of How Predicting Housing Prices in 1 Neighbourhood would work and applied it to different neighbourhoods, if your model was simple, it wouldn’t work well anywhere and thus would be Wrong, but consistently-ish wrong. If your model was Good, it would work similarly well every well. If you model was overfit, it would work really well in 1 place, not so well elsewhere.
"
Model Evaluation,Feature Selection,Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC),"Graphical tool used to evaluate the performance of a binary classifier by plotting the true positive rate against the false positive rate across varying decision thresholds. It originated during World War II in signal detection theory to assess radar system performance. ROC analysis is important because it separates a model’s discriminative ability from any single threshold choice. The curve and its summary statistic, the Area Under the Curve (AUC), provide a threshold-independent measure of performance. ROC is widely used in machine learning, medicine, finance, and risk modeling where trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity matter."
Model Evaluation,Feature Selection,F1 Score,"F1 is harmonic mean is a type of average that is calculated by dividing the number of values by the sum of the reciprocals of the values, making it useful for situations where rates or ratios are involved, such as calculating average speeds or in situations where equal weighting is given to each data point’s contribution to the average. The F-score (or F1-score) is a measure of a model’s accuracy that considers both precision and recall. The F1-score is particularly useful when your dataset is imbalanced, and you want to ensure both precision and recall are considered. For example, if you only focus on precision, you might ignore false negatives (missed positive cases), and if you focus only on recall, you could have many false positives. The F1-score provides a balanced assessment by combining both metrics. The F Score is a Harmonic Mean, which means that it gives additional consideration to the effect of Lower Values (1/ sum (1/x)). Using travel time as an example, if you travelled 20 Miles (10 Miles at 30 MPH and 10 Miles at 60 MPH) your harmonic mean would be 36, not 45."
Model Evaluation,Feature Selection,Precision,"Precision is the ratio of correct positive predictions to the overall number of Positive Predictions.  It is useful when false positives are costly (e.g., spam detection, where predicting a normal email as spam is bad)."
Model Evaluation,Feature Selection,Recall,"Recall is the correct positive predicitions to the overall number of positive examples. It is useful when false negatives are costly (e.g., medical diagnosis, where missing a disease case can be dangerous)."

"Bias, Fairness, and Ethics",Process Step,Requirement,"Document fairness checks and mitigation steps. Supports transparency, accountability, and compliance."
Process Development,Process Step,Documented,"Written down in a clear, accessible format that describes the steps, roles, and expectations. Documentation creates a single source of truth and reduces reliance on memory or informal knowledge. This is important because it ensures consistency, supports training, and allows the process to be sustained even when staff or circumstances change. 

Documented is not sufficient, it must be accessible, available and known. Even when these conditions are met, one must acknowledge that the vast majoirty of people are likely not interested, or willing to read."
Process Development,Process Step,Communicated,"Actively shared with all relevant stakeholders so they understand what the process is, why it matters, and how to follow it. Communication includes orientation, reminders, and opportunities for clarification. This is important because even the best-designed process will fail if people are unaware of it or misunderstand their roles, or forget."
Process Development,Process Step,Supported,"Ancillary resources must be available to support implementation and perfection, which is critically important at the outset. This includes  training, coaching, tools, and ongoing guidance, and learning. Another critical compoent of this is monitoring and feedback which is necssary to ensure the process is being applied as intended and working as expected, as it is critical to acknowledge imperfections (or complete failure as appropriate)."
Process Development,Process Step,Measured,"Includes defined metrics that track whether the process is being followed and whether it is producing the intended results. Measurement provides objective evidence of performance, progress, and areas needing improvement. This is important because without measurement, it is difficult to know if the process is effective or where adjustments are required.

Also, it is critical to remember that individuals without feedback, may honestly not understand whether they are following a process as designed and intended, depsite their best efforts."
Process Development,Process Step,Simple,"Easy to understand, follow, and execute without unnecessary steps or complexity. Simplicity reduces errors, shortens training time, and makes the process more adaptable to change. The more complex a process is, the less likely it will truly generalize or obtain the support and adoption necessary to perfect and embed."
Process Development,Process Step,Clear,"Communicates expectations, roles, and steps in a way that leaves little room for confusion or interpretation. It ensures that everyone involved understands what to do, when to do it, and how success is defined. Clarity is important because it promotes consistency, accountability, and smooth coordination across teams."
Process Development,Process Step,Evident,"Makes the right actions and outcomes visible through straightforward steps, cues, or built-in checks. It allows people to quickly see whether the process is being followed correctly and whether it is producing the intended results. This is important because visibility helps teams detect issues early and maintain quality."
Process Development,Process Step,Obvious,"Mmakes the correct next step intuitive, even for someone new or unfamiliar with the work. It reduces reliance on memory, interpretation, or specialized knowledge to complete tasks correctly. This is important because when the right action is obvious, compliance increases and variation decreases, leading to more reliable outcomes."
Process Development,Process Step,Accountability,"Are Roles and Responsbilities explicity stated? and Is it clear who is responsible for what. Are goals SMART (or atleast defined) or at a minimum, is our partcipation understood and documented.  "
Clustering,Consideration,Goal Setting,"With clustering, the following strategic outcomes can be achieved: 
Strategic Conversations become diagnostic not reactive
Precision without Personalization
Differenitation without Discrimination
Optimization without cumbersome rules"
Clustering,Process Step,Implementation,"Goals of a clustering project can greatly differ, as such there is no universal approach, and in fact the type of clustering which one undertakes differs greatly depending upon goals, objectives, expected outcomes and availabiltiy of data.

At the simplest, the type of Clustering (Supervised vs Unsupervised) is likely the first and easiest distinction, types after that depend on size of data, goals, implementation (real time vs batch), time frame (spot vs time series, member vs member, member vs self, etc).

Example of Behavior Goal: Small Number of Stable, Interpretable, Member Archetypes that summaize the global behavior and can be reused for ML and Analysis."
Clustering,Process Step,Goal Setting,"A classification, via calculation utilizing mathematical precision to identify based on numeric similarity, attributes, characteristics, properties and behaviours across multidimensional space.

Clustering,Model Evaluation,Variance Inflation Factor,"
Variance Inflation Factor  a numerical measure of how much multicollinearity (linear redundancy) exists between one feature and all the other features in your dataset. How many duplicates of this feature exist in the dataset, expressed as variance inflation. VIF matters because multicollinearity causes problems in models that rely on distances or linear structure. It creates several issues:"
Clustering,Model Evaluation,Inertia,"Quantitative measure used in clustering, particularly in K-means, to describe how tightly data points are grouped around their assigned cluster centroids. The term originates from classical physics, where inertia refers to resistance to change, and was later adopted in statistics and machine learning as an analogy for within-group compactness. In machine learning, inertia is defined as the sum of squared distances between each data point and the centroid of its assigned cluster. It is important because it provides a direct, intuitive measure of cluster compactness and is the objective function minimized during K-means optimization. In practice, inertia is commonly used to evaluate clustering quality and to help select the number of clusters using techniques such as the elbow method."
Clustering,Model Evaluation,Davies–Bouldin Index,"Internal clustering evaluation metric that measures the average similarity between each cluster and its most similar neighboring cluster. It was introduced in 1979 by David L. Davies and Donald W. Bouldin as a way to quantify clustering quality without requiring ground-truth labels. The index combines both intra-cluster dispersion and inter-cluster separation, penalizing solutions where clusters are poorly separated or internally diffuse. It is important because it provides a single scalar value that reflects the trade-off between compactness and separation, two core objectives in clustering. In practice, the Davies–Bouldin Index is widely used to compare clustering solutions and to tune hyperparameters such as the number of clusters.
“How bad is my worst neighboring cluster?” → Lower is better"
Clustering,Model Evaluation,Calinski–Harabasz Index,"Also known as the Variance Ratio Criterion, is an internal clustering evaluation metric that assesses cluster quality by comparing between-cluster dispersion to within-cluster dispersion. It was proposed in 1974 by Tadeusz Calinski and Jerzy Harabasz in the context of multivariate statistical analysis. The index is important because it directly reflects how well clusters are separated relative to how compact they are, normalized by the number of clusters and data points. Higher values indicate better-defined clustering structures with dense, well-separated groups. In practice, the Calinski–Harabasz Index is commonly used to select the optimal number of clusters, particularly in K-means and other centroid-based algorithms.

ML Model,Definition,Activation Function,"A mathematical function applied to a neuron’s weighted input that introduces non-linearity into a neural network. This non-linearity enables the model to learn complex, non-linear relationships in the data. Activation functions are applied within layers during the forward pass of a neural network, transforming intermediate representations before passing them to the next layer. Activation choice affects gradient flow, training stability, and convergence speed. Poor choices can cause vanishing or exploding gradients, limiting the depth or effectiveness of the network"
ML Model,Definition,Loss Function,"A loss function is a mathematical function that measures how far a model’s predictions are from the true target values, producing a single scalar value that represents prediction error and defines the objective to be minimized during training. The loss function is evaluated during training after the forward pass and is the starting point for backpropagation. Its gradients drive parameter updates via the optimizer. Different loss functions encode different assumptions about error, robustness, and business objectives. Choosing an inappropriate loss can lead to models that optimize the wrong behavior, even if training converges successfully."
ML Model,Definition,Model,"The model is the mathematical or algorithmic structure used to map input features to predictions. This includes selecting the model family (e.g., linear models, tree-based models, neural networks) and defining its architecture. Model choice balances predictive power, interpretability, computational cost, and deployment constraints. The model defines howlearning occurs but does not yet involve learning itself."
ML Model,Definition,Optimizer,"Optimization algorithm that updates a model’s parameters using gradients of the loss function in order to minimize training error. It defines how gradient information is transformed into parameter updates. The optimizer operates during training, after gradients are computed via backpropagation, and is not used during inference. Different optimizers trade off convergence speed, stability, and generalization. Hyperparameters such as learning rate and momentum are"
ML Model,Definition,Regularization,"Technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. It discourages the model from fitting too closely to the training data, ensuring better generalization to unseen data. Traditionnaly results in bias, at benefit of materially lowering Variance.

ML Model,Guiding Principle,Optimization,"Optimization is the process of finding the best possible solution to a problem by systematically adjusting inputs or decisions to maximize or minimize a defined objective, subject to given constraints. In machine learning and analytics, optimization involves selecting model parameters that minimize error or maximize performance according to a chosen loss function. Importantly, what is considered “best” depends entirely on how the objective and constraints are defined."
ML Model,Guiding Principle,Deep Learning,"Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layer neural networks to automatically learn hierarchical representations from data, reducing the need for manual feature engineering. By stacking simple processing units called layers—each acting as a filter that transforms inputs into higher-level representations—deep learning models can capture complex patterns through composition. Early challenges such as vanishing gradients, where learning signals faded through many layers, were largely addressed through improved activation functions, optimization methods, and weight initialization strategies. In practice, building a deep learning model involves defining the network architecture (number of layers, connections, and activations) and then specifying how it learns by choosing an optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics during compilation."

ML Model,Algorithm,Gradient Descent,"Widely used optimization algorithm in machine learning, particularly for training models like neural networks. Its primary goal is to minimize a loss function, which measures the error between the model's predictions and the actual outcomes, by iteratively adjusting the model’s parameters.

Traditional Gradient Descent vs. Stochastic Gradient Descent
In Batch Gradient Descent, the algorithm computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model’s parameters using the entire dataset before updating the parameters. While this approach provides a precise update direction, it is computationally expensive and slow for large datasets since it requires processing all data points in each iteration.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) addresses this issue by approximating the gradient. Instead of computing gradients over the full dataset, SGD updates the model’s parameters using just a single data point at each step. This significantly reduces computational cost per iteration, making the algorithm much faster. However, since updates are based on a single random sample, they introduce high variance (noise), causing fluctuations that may prevent smooth convergence.
Mini-Batch Gradient Descent: To balance efficiency and stability, a common alternative is Mini-Batch Gradient Descent. Instead of using the full dataset (Batch Gradient Descent) or a single data point (SGD), Mini-Batch Gradient Descent computes updates using a small batch of randomly selected data points (e.g., 32, 64, or 128 samples per batch). This approach: Reduces noise compared to SGD while still being computationally efficient. 
Leverages vectorized operations for faster computation using modern hardware (e.g., GPUs).
Smooths out updates while still allowing some stochasticity to escape local minima.
Benefits & Trade-offs of SGD
Faster updates: Each iteration is computationally cheaper than full-batch gradient descent.
Better exploration: The randomness in updates helps escape local minima.
Higher variance: The noisier updates may lead to less stable convergence, requiring techniques like learning rate decay or momentum to improve performance.
Slower convergence: Since updates are less precise, SGD may take longer to reach the optimal solution.
Conclusion
SGD, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent, and Batch Gradient Descent each offer different trade-offs in terms of speed, stability, and computational efficiency. In practice, Mini-Batch Gradient Descent is the most commonly used approach for deep learning, as it provides a balance between computational efficiency and convergence stability."

ML Model,Algorithm,HuberRegressor,"HuberRegressor is a robust linear regression model that uses the Huber loss function, which behaves like squared error for small rsiduals and absolute error for large residuals, reducing sensitivity to outliers. It originates from Peter J. Huber’s work in the 1960s on robust statistics, where he introduced the Huber loss as a compromise between least squares and least absolute deviations. Its importance lies in providing stable, reliable parameter estimates when datasets contain noise or outliers that would disproportionately influence ordinary linear regression. HuberRegressor is commonly used in supervised learning for regression problems where data quality is uneven or heavy-tailed. Typical applications include finance, economics, sensor data analysis, and any real-world modeling scenario where robustness matters more than strict optimality under ideal assumptions"

Model strengths include : Simple, interpretable, computationally efficient, works well for linearly separable data. Weaknesses, Assumes linear relationships, sensitive to outliers. Can calculate using two different approaches, Closed Form or Gradient Decent. Closed Form Solution was the original approach, can be calculated using advanced Calculus, which is easy for simple instances with a low number of independent variables, however Gradient Decent increasingly utilized as easy to implement via numeric calculation,  Python Linear Regression utilizies Pseudoinverse, which is computationally less expensive. However, it is Big O 2² to 2³, which means doubling features increases computations complexity 4 times.

Cost function for Linear Regression is usually Mean Squared Error. While it does not have to be, it is convenient for a number of reasons. 
1) Rarely Overfits, which Polynomial equations frequently do. 
2) It always has a derivative, which makes it convenient for using closed forms solutions (saving computation complexity). Historically was applied via Closed Form Solution, which can be difficult to calculate, computationally expensive. "
ML Model,Algorithm,LinearDiscriminantAnalysis,"Supervised statistical learning method used for classification and dimensionality reduction. It originated from the work of Ronald A.

LDA is important because it explicitly incorporates class labels to find feature projections that best separate groups, unlike unsupervised methods such as PCA. In practice, LDA is commonly applied in pattern recognition, bioinformatics, finance, and any domain where interpretability and class separation are critical.

ML Model,Algorithm,NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis,Neighborhood Components Analysis is a supervised dimensionality reduction and metric learning method that learns a transformation optimizing nearest-neighbor classification performance. It originated in the context of distance metric learning to improve k-NN accuracy. Its importance comes from directly aligning feature space geometry with predictive performance rather than variance preservation. NCA is commonly applied in classification tasks where distance-based reasoning is critical. It learns task-specific representations rather than general-purpose embeddings.
ML Model,Algorithm,Neural Network,
ML Model,Algorithm,NMF,"Non-negative Matrix Factorization is a matrix decomposition technique that factorizes a non-negative data matrix into two lower-rank non-negative matrices, typically interpreted as parts-based representations of the original data. It was popularized in the late 1990s by Daniel D. Lee and H. Sebastian Seung, who showed that the non-negativity constraint leads to more interpretable components than methods like PCA or SVD. NMF is important because it aligns well with many real-world datasets where values are naturally non-negative (e.g., counts, intensities, frequencies) and because its components often correspond to meaningful latent factors. It is widely used in unsupervised learning for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. Common applications include topic modeling in text analysis, image and signal processing, bioinformatics (e.g., gene expression analysis), and customer behavior segmentation."

It originated in the early 2000s from work in statistical learning and bioinformatics, most notably Guyon et al. (2002) for gene selection using support vector machines. Its importance lies in reducing model complexity, improving generalization, and increasing interpretability by systematically identifying the most predictive subset of features.

It emerged from ensemble learning research in the 1990s, building on the idea that diverse models capture different patterns in data. Its importance lies in its ability to improve predictive performance beyond any single model by leveraging complementary strengths. Stacking is especially effective when base models are heterogeneous (e.g., trees, linear models, SVMs). It is commonly applied in high-stakes predictive tasks such as fraud detection, credit scoring, and machine-learning competitions."

ML Model,Algorithm,Support Vector Machines,"Finds the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes in a feature space. The hyperplane is chosen to maximize the margin, which is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class, known as support vectors. By default, generally a Linear Line, however can utilize Kernels to change, such that datasets where decision boundary is not linearly seperable can become so in higher dimensions.

ModelStrengths: Effective in high-dimensional spaces, works well with clear margins of separation. Model Weaknesses:Computationally expensive, struggles with large datasets."
ML Model,Algorithm,Support Vector Regression,"SVR tries to fit a function within a margin of tolerance (epsilon) around the true data points — instead of minimizing the error between predicted and actual values like in ordinary least squares regression. Margin of Tolerance (ε): Instead of minimizing all errors, SVR ignores errors as long as they're within this ""epsilon-tube"" around the true values.Support Vectors: Only data points outside the epsilon margin contribute to the model (i.e., they influence the regression line).Kernel Trick: Like SVM, SVR can use kernels (e.g., linear, RBF) to model nonlinear relationships."
ML Model,Algorithm,Support Vector Classifier (SVC),"Supervised machine learning algorithm based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) framework, designed for classification tasks. It originated in the 1990s from statistical learning theory, with foundations laid by Vladimir Vapnik and colleagues.

ML Model,Algorithm,Centroid-based clustering,"Centroid-based clustering groups data points by assigning each point to the nearest representative center (centroid). It answers the question: “What are the main archetypal behavior patterns in the data?” Its strengths are scalability, stability, and interpretability, making it well suited for large datasets and business-facing segmentation. Its main weakness is that it assumes roughly spherical clusters and requires the number of clusters (K) to be chosen in advance."
ML Model,Algorithm,KMeans,"KMeans is a centroid-based clustering algorithm that iteratively updates cluster centers to minimize within-cluster variance. It produces a single cluster label per observation, making it easy to summarize and communicate results. KMeans is fast, widely understood, and works well when clusters are well-separated and similarly sized. However, it is sensitive to feature scaling, outliers, and the choice of K."
ML Model,Algorithm,MiniBatchKMeans,MiniBatchKMeans is a scalable variant of KMeans that updates centroids using small random subsets of data. It answers the same questions as KMeans but is designed for large datasets where full batch updates are expensive. Its strengths are speed and memory efficiency with minimal loss in cluster quality. The trade-off is slightly higher variability and less precise centroids compared to full KMeans.
ML Model,Algorithm,HDBSCAN,HDBSCAN is an extension of DBSCAN that builds a hierarchy of density-based clusters and selects stable ones automatically. It answers similar questions to DBSCAN but with improved robustness and less manual parameter tuning. Its strengths are better performance on real-world data and more reliable cluster discovery. Its weaknesses include higher computational cost and more complex interpretation.
ML Model,Algorithm,Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM),A Gaussian Mixture Model assumes data is generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions and assigns each observation a probability of belonging to each cluster. It is useful for soft segmentation and identifying transitional or ambiguous cases. GMMs are more flexible than KMeans but require careful feature scaling and can be unstable on high-dimensional or noisy data. They are best used when overlap between segments is expected and meaningful.
ML Model,Algorithm,Graph-based clustering,"Graph-based clustering represents data as a network where nodes are observations and edges represent similarity, then identifies communities within the graph. It answers the question: “What natural communities emerge from pairwise relationships?” Its strength is capturing complex, non-linear structure that other methods miss. Its weaknesses are scalability challenges and difficulty explaining results to non-technical stakeholders."
ML Model,Algorithm,kNN graph clustering,kNN graph clustering builds a graph by connecting each observation to its nearest neighbors and then finds communities within that graph. It is useful for discovering local structure and non-obvious groupings in complex data. Its strength is flexibility and sensitivity to fine-grained patterns. Its weakness is computational cost and dependence on similarity definitions and neighborhood size.
ML Model,Algorithm,Hard Voting,"Hard voting is an ensemble decision strategy where multiple classifiers each cast a single class prediction, and the final output is determined by majority vote. It emerged from early ensemble and committee-based learning approaches. Its importance lies in its simplicity and robustness, particularly when individual models make uncorrelated errors. Hard voting is most effective when all models have comparable performance and confidence calibration is not required. It is commonly used in baseline ensemble classifiers and interpretable decision systems."
ML Model,Algorithm,Soft Voting,"Soft voting is an ensemble technique where classifiers output class probabilities, which are averaged (or weighted) to determine the final prediction. It evolved as probabilistic classifiers became more common and better calibrated. Soft voting is important because it incorporates confidence information, often leading to better performance than hard voting. It is especially effective when combining diverse models with well-calibrated probability outputs. Soft voting is widely used in production ML systems and competitive modeling."
ML Model,Algorithm,Naive Bayes,"Naive Bayes is a family of probabilistic machine learning algorithms based on Bayes’ theorem, which describes how to update probabilities as new evidence is observed. The method originated from the work of Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century statistician and theologian, whose theorem later became foundational in statistical inference. It is called “naive” because it assumes that all input features are independent of each other given the class, an assumption that is often unrealistic but works surprisingly well in practice. Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes is highly effective for high-dimensional data, particularly in text classification and spam detection. Its importance lies in its speed, interpretability, and strong baseline performance, making it a common first model in many machine learning workflows."
ML Model,Algorithm,Hierarchical Navigable Small World,"HNSW is an algorithm used for fast approximate nearest-neighbor search in high-dimensional data, such as embeddings used in machine learning and vector databases. It organizes data points into a multi-layer graph where each node connects to similar neighbors, allowing searches to quickly navigate toward the closest matches. The hierarchical structure enables efficient coarse-to-fine searching, which greatly reduces lookup time compared to checking all vectors. HNSW is widely used in modern vector search systems because it provides a strong balance between speed, scalability, and search accuracy."
ML Model,Pipeline Stage,Model Summarization / Model Interpretability,"Model summarization and interpretability aim to explain how the model makes decisions. This may include feature importance, partial dependence plots, SHAP values, or rule extraction. Interpretability builds trust with stakeholders and supports debugging, governance, and compliance. It is especially critical in high-stakes or regulated domains."
ML Model,Pipeline Stage,Monitoring,"Monitoring tracks model performance and behavior over time after deployment. It includes detecting data drift, concept drift, performance degradation, and operational issues. Alerts and retraining triggers are often established at this stage. Monitoring is essential because real-world data changes, and models degrade if left unattended."
ML Model,Pipeline Stage,Problem Definition,"Problem definition clearly states the business or research question the model is intended to solve and translates it into a machine-learning task (e.g., classification, regression, ranking). It includes defining the target variable, success metrics, constraints (latency, interpretability, cost), and assumptions. This step aligns stakeholders on what success looks likebefore any data or modeling begins. A poorly defined problem almost always leads to building the “right model for the wrong problem.”"
ML Model,Pipeline Stage,Training,"Training is the process of fitting the model to data by optimizing its parameters to minimize a loss function. During training, the model learns patterns by iteratively adjusting weights based on observed errors. This step may involve batching, optimization algorithms, and regularization techniques. Proper training ensures the model captures meaningful signal without overfitting."
ML Model,Pipeline Stage,Validation,"Process which evaluates a trained machine-learning model on data that was not used during training to assess how well it generalizes to unseen data. It is used to tune model choices and hyperparameters, detect overfitting or underfitting, and guide model selection before final testing or deployment. Validation acts as a feedback loop before final evaluation or deployment decisions are made."
ML Model,Theorem,Curse of Dimensionality,"As dimensionality grows, data points become increasingly sparse, distances lose meaning, and models require exponentially more data to learn reliable patterns. This makes learning, generalization, and computation more difficult, often degrading model performance rather than improving it. In high-dimensional spaces, the optimization landscape also becomes far more complex, with many local minima and saddle points, making it harder to identify or converge toward a meaningful global minimum."

ML Model,Model Type,Reinforcement Learning,"Reinforcement learning trains an agent to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties. The agent learns a policy that maximizes cumulative reward over time through trial and error. It is commonly used in robotics, game playing, and control systems."
ML Model,Model Type,Semisupervised Learning,Semi-supervised learning combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data to improve learning performance. The model leverages the structure in the unlabeled data to generalize better than supervised learning alone. This approach is useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.
ML Model,Model Type,Supervised Learning,"Supervised learning trains a model using labeled data, where the correct answer is known in advance. The model learns a mapping from inputs to outputs by minimizing the difference between its predictions and the true labels. Common examples include classification and regression problems."
ML Model,Model Type,Unsupervised Learning,"Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data and aims to discover hidden patterns or structure. The model groups, compresses, or summarizes the data without being told what the correct outcome is. Typical use cases include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection."
ML Model,Model Type,Assessment,"Assessment refers to techniques that do not learn patterns from data but instead evaluate, diagnose, or measure the behavior, performance, or reliability of models or data. These methods operate on model outputs, predictions, or residuals rather than updating model parameters. Assessment is essential for understanding model quality, robustness, and fitness for purpose, but it does not produce a trained model. This learning type characterizes analytical or evaluative tools rather than learning algorithms."
ML Model,Model Architecture,Autoregressive,"Autoregressive models generate outputs one step at a time, where each prediction depends on the previously generated outputs. This sequential dependency allows the model to capture context and coherence, making it powerful for tasks like language modeling and time-series forecasting. However, because predictions are made step by step, autoregressive methods can be slower at inference compared to parallel approaches."
ML Model,Evaluation,Silhouette Score,"Measures how well each data point fits within its assigned cluster compared to the nearest alternative cluster. It compares the average distance to points in the same cluster (cohesion) against the average distance to points in the closest neighboring cluster (separation). Scores range from −1 to 1, where higher values indicate tighter and more clearly separated clusters. The overall Silhouette Score is the average of these values across all data points and is best used to compare clustering configurations rather than as an absolute measure of quality.

> 0.5: Strong clustering

Mathematics,Definition,Euclidean distance ,"Straight-line distance between two points in space, calculated as the square root of the sum of squared differences across each dimension. It is important because it provides a natural, intuitive measure of similarity in continuous numeric spaces and underpins many algorithms in geometry, physics, and machine learning (especially distance-based methods like clustering). The concept originates from Euclid, whose Elements (circa 300 BCE) formalized geometry based on distances and angles in flat space. In modern data science, Euclidean distance generalizes this idea to higher dimensions, where each feature represents an axis in space."
Mathematics,Definition,Density-based clustering,"Density-based clustering identifies clusters as regions of high point density separated by sparse regions. It answers the question: “Which observations naturally group together, and which ones are unusual or isolated?” Its strengths include the ability to detect arbitrarily shaped clusters and identify outliers as noise. Its weaknesses are sensitivity to hyperparameters and reduced stability on very large or unevenly distributed datasets."
Mathematics,Definition,Probabilistic clustering,"Probabilistic clustering models data as coming from overlapping probability distributions rather than assigning hard cluster boundaries. It answers the question: “To what degree does this observation belong to each group?” Its strength is capturing uncertainty and mixed behaviors, which is often more realistic in human or financial data. The weakness is increased complexity, sensitivity to assumptions, and reduced interpretability for non-technical audiences."
Mathematics,Definition,Instance Based Learning,"Instance-Based Learning is a learning paradigm where predictions or inferences are made by directly comparing new observations to stored examples rather than learning an explicit global model. It answers the question: “What past observations most closely resemble this one?” Its strengths are simplicity, transparency, and flexibility, as it makes few assumptions about the underlying data structure. Its weaknesses include sensitivity to feature scaling and noise, lack of global summarization, and higher computational cost at inference time for large datasets"
Mathematics,Definition,Acyclic Graph,"A graph that does not contain any cycles. This means there is no path in the graph that starts from a node and eventually returns to the same node. There are 2 types of Acyclic Graphs, Directed and Undirected. "

Mathematics,Definition,Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE),"Measures differences between Prediction and Actual as expressed by percentages, opposed to absolute error. Scale indepedent, not as useful when values near zero."
Mathematics,Definition,Margin of Error,"The margin of error represents the range within which the true population value is expected to lie, given the sample estimate. It is usually expressed as a percentage (e.g., ±5%). It helps determine how precise or reliable the sample estimate is, indicating the level of uncertainty in the results."
Mathematics,Definition,Manifold Hypothesis,"The manifold hypothesis suggests that although data lives in a very high-dimensional space, the meaningful structure (e.g., images of digits) lies on a much lower-dimensional surface (the manifold). While digits like ""3"" and ""8"" are visually distinct, they are all constrained by shared generative factors (stroke thickness, slant, etc.), so they occupy nearby regions of this manifold — which is tiny compared to the full space. A manifold is a smooth shape that may curve and twist in space but can be described with a few dimensions. Machine learning models assume that high-dimensional data lies on such a shape, allowing them to learn simpler patterns."
Mathematics,Definition,Grapth Theory,"Branch of mathematics focused on the study of graphs, which model relationships using nodes (vertices) and connections (edges) between them. It originated in 1736 with Leonhard Euler’s solution to the Königsberg bridge problem, widely regarded as the first formal result in the field. Graph Theory is important because it provides a powerful and flexible framework for representing and analyzing complex relational structures. It underpins many modern algorithms by enabling reasoning about connectivity, flow, influence, and structure in systems. Applications span computer science and data science (networks, search, recommendation systems), operations research (routing, scheduling), biology (protein and gene interaction networks), and social sciences (social and organizational networks)"
Mathematics,Definition,Heteroskedasticity,"Condition in which the variance of errors (or residuals) in a model is not constant across observations. The term originates from econometrics, combining the Greek hetero (different) and skedasis (dispersion). It is important because many statistical models—especially linear regression—assume constant variance (homoskedasticity), and violations can lead to inefficient estimates and misleading confidence intervals. In practice, heteroskedasticity commonly appears in financial, economic, and behavioral data where variability grows with scale (e.g., higher income → more variable spending). Addressing it often involves transformations, robust standard errors, or alternative models."
Mathematics,Definition,Non-Gaussian,"Data or error distributions that do not follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution. The concept arises from probability theory and statistics, where the Gaussian distribution is often assumed due to its mathematical convenience and the Central Limit Theorem. Its importance lies in the fact that many real-world datasets—such as financial returns, network traffic, or biological signals—exhibit skewness, heavy tails, or multimodality that violate normality assumptions. Non-Gaussian data can significantly affect model performance and inference if not properly handled. In applications, this often motivates the use of robust statistics, nonparametric methods, or models explicitly designed for alternative distributions."
Mathematics,Definition,Multicollinearity,"When two or more predictor variables in a model are highly correlated with one another. The term comes from regression analysis and highlights a structural issue rather than a data-quality problem. It is important because multicollinearity inflates variance in coefficient estimates, making them unstable and difficult to interpret, even if overall model performance appears strong. This can obscure the true relationship between predictors and the target variable. In practice, multicollinearity is addressed through feature selection, dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA), or regularization techniques like Ridge regression."
Mathematics,Definition,Weighted Bipartite Graph,"Graph structure that represents relationships between two distinct types of entities, where connections exist only across types and not within the same type. In this model, one set of nodes represents individuals and the other represents accounts, and each edge represents an authority or relationship linking a person to an account. The weight assigned to each edge quantifies the relative strength, influence, or significance of that relationship (for example, full signing authority versus limited or advisory roles). This structure enables systematic aggregation and projection of relationships (such as person-to-person connections) while preserving the underlying role-based semantics and relative strength of authority."
Mathematics,Definition,Embedding,"Learned numerical representation of an object (such as a word, sentence, image, or user) in a continuous vector space. It maps complex, high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space where semantic or structural relationships are preserved. The goal of an embedding is to place similar items closer together and dissimilar items farther apart in that space. Embeddings are widely used in machine learning for tasks like search, recommendation systems, clustering, and natural language processing."
Mathematics,Definition,Embedding Vector,"Actual numeric output produced by an embedding model. It is a list (or array) of numbers—often hundreds or thousands of dimensions—that represents a specific object in vector space. This vector is what gets stored, compared, indexed, or used in downstream tasks such as similarity search or classification. While “embedding” refers to the representation concept, the embedding vector refers to the concrete numerical data generated for a particular instance."

Mathematics,Theorem,Best Linear Unbiased Estimator,"The Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) is an estimation method in statistics that produces parameter estimates that are linear in the observed data, unbiased, and have the smallest possible variance among all such estimators. It originates from the Gauss–Markov theorem, developed in the early 19th century in the context of least squares and error theory. Its importance lies in providing a theoretical benchmark: under specific assumptions about error structure, no other linear unbiased estimator can be more precise. In practice, BLUE underpins ordinary and generalized least squares, and is widely applied in econometrics, engineering, and data science when modeling relationships with correlated or heteroskedastic errors"
Mathematics,Theorem,Algorithm,"An algorithm is a procedure that unfolds over time and depends on: previous states, iteration history and accumulated information."
Mathematics,Theorem,Naive Bayes,"Principle in probability theory that describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. It was first developed by Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century English statistician and theologian, and later formalized and popularized by Pierre-Simon Laplace. The theorem provides a mathematical relationship between prior probability (initial belief), likelihood (evidence), and posterior probability (updated belief). Its importance lies in its ability to support reasoning under uncertainty, making it a core concept in statistics, machine learning, medicine, finance, and decision science. In machine learning, it forms the foundation of the Naive Bayes algorithm, where it is used to estimate class probabilities based on observed features.

Adding Naive Assumption assumes independence, which drastically simplifies the calculation."
Mathematics,Formula,Cosine Distance,"Cosine Distance converts cosine similarity into a distance metric. It measures dissimilarity based on angular separation between vectors. A value of $0$ means identical direction, while values closer to $1$ indicate greater dissimilarity. It is typically defined as: cosine distance=1−cosine similarity"
Mathematics,Formula,Euclidean Distance,Euclidean Distance measures the straight-line distance between two vectors in space. It represents the geometric distance between two points in an $n$-dimensional space. Smaller values indicate vectors are closer together in absolute magnitude.
Mathematics,Formula,Dot Product,"The dot product measures the degree to which two vectors point in the same direction. It combines both magnitude and directional alignment. Larger positive values indicate stronger alignment, while negative values indicate opposite directions"
Mathematics,Formula,Cosine Similarity,"Cosine Similarity measures the similarity between two vectors based solely on their direction, not magnitude. It computes the cosine of the angle between them, making it especially useful for text embeddings where vector length may vary. Values range from $-1$ (opposite direction) to $1$ (same direction)."
Algorthim Classification,Definition,Evaluation,"
As a general term, Evaluation has multiple meanings, so care is required to be explicit about its usage. In the context of machine learning, Evaluation has two distinct and valid meanings: one as an Algorithm Classification and one as an ML Pipeline Stage. These uses are related but serve different conceptual purposes.

Algorithm Class: Methods that quantify the performance, quality, or reliability of models or learned structures. These techniques produce metrics, scores, or diagnostic summaries rather than predictions or feature transformations. Evaluation methods support model comparison, validation, and selection but do not directly influence how models are trained or how decisions are made."
Algorthim Classification,Definition,Decision Strategy,"A Decision Strategy is a method used to determine a final outcome by applying rules or aggregation logic to one or more intermediate model outputs, scores, or signals. It originates from decision theory and ensemble methods, where the focus is on how decisions are made rather than how predictions are generated. Decision strategies are important because they separate prediction from decision-making, allowing the same models to support different operational or business objectives. They operate downstream of models and do not learn feature representations or decision boundaries themselves. Common applications include ensemble voting, thresholding, ranking, arbitration between systems, and policy-driven decision logic."
Algorthim Classification,Parameter,Anomaly Detection,"Algorithm which designed to identify observations that deviate significantly from expectedor normal patterns. Its importance lies in surfacing rare, unusual, or potentially harmful events that standard predictive models may overlook. It is applied in domains such as fraud detection, system monitoring, and quality control, where outliers themselves are the signal rather than noise."
Algorthim Classification,Parameter,Classification,"Algorithm which assign observations to one of a finite set of discrete categories based on learned patterns in labeled data. The goal is to predict which class an observation belongs to, not how much or how many. Classification is foundational in tasks such as diagnosis, spam detection, and customer segmentation with predefined labels."
Algorthim Classification,Parameter,Clustering,"Algorithm which group observations into clusters based on similarity without using labeled outcomes. The objective is to discover latent structure or natural groupings within data rather than to predict predefined categories. Clustering is commonly applied in exploratory analysis, segmentation, and pattern discovery."
Algorthim Classification,Parameter,Decision Strategy," Methods that define how predictions or model outputs are converted into final decisions. These techniques operate on outputs from one or more models rather than directly on raw features. Examples include voting schemes, thresholding, cost-sensitive decisions, and calibration strategies."
Algorthim Classification,Parameter,Density Estimation,"Approaches which involve modeling the underlying probability distribution of data points in feature space. Its importance lies in understanding data generation, uncertainty, and likelihood rather than predicting labels directly. Density estimation is often used as a foundation for anomaly detection, clustering, and probabilistic reasoning."
Algorthim Classification,Parameter,Dimensionality Reduction,"Algorithm which reduce the number of variables by projecting data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving important structure or information. These methods aim to simplify data for visualization, noise reduction, or downstream modeling. The key distinction is that they create new latent features, rather than selecting from existing ones."
Algorthim Classification,Parameter,Feature Transformation,"
Methods which modify existing features into new representations to improve learning, scale, or interpretability. Unlike dimensionality reduction, transformed features often retain a direct relationship to original variables. This category includes normalization, encoding, and learned transformations used as preprocessing steps."
Algorthim Classification,Parameter,Feature Selection,"Methods that identify and retain a subset of existing features based on their relevance, importance, or contribution to a learning task. The goal is to reduce model complexity, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability without creating new features or altering their definitions. Feature selection techniques are typically applied as preprocessing or model-selection steps and often rely on statistical criteria or model-based importance measures."
Algorthim Classification,Parameter,Ranking / Recommendation,"Algorithm which order items or suggest relevant options based on predicted relevance, preference, or utility. The objective is not classification or regression, but relative prioritization among alternatives. These methods are central to search, personalization, and content discovery systems."
Algorthim Classification,Parameter,Regression,"Algorithm which predict continuous numerical values by modeling relationships between input features and a target variable. The emphasis is on estimating magnitude and direction rather than categorical assignment. Regression is widely used in forecasting, risk estimation, and trend analysis."

Tooling,Definition,Pytorch,"PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework primarily used for research, experimentation, and custom model development. It features eager execution and dynamic computation graphs, which allow models to run and be debugged step by step like standard Python code. PyTorch is highly Pythonic and integrates naturally with the scientific Python ecosystem, making it well suited for rapid prototyping and novel model architectures. A common limitation is that additional engineering effort may be required when moving experimental models into large-scale production environments."
Tooling,Definition,Tensor Flow,"TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework designed to support building, training, and deploying models across a wide range of platforms. It provides high-level APIs that simplify model creation while also offering tools for large-scale, production-grade deployment. TensorFlow’s ecosystem includes specialized solutions for serving, mobile, and web environments, making it suitable for enterprise and embedded use cases. Its complexity and abstraction layers can introduce a steeper learning curve for low-level customization."
Tooling,Definition,Spark,"A fast and general engine for large scale data processing. Distributes information across nodes to limit strain and bottleneck on individual machine. Runs ontop of a cluster Manager, script like any other script, Spark knows how to distribute . Master Program run code and manages interactions between slave tasks (executors). Can run ontop of a Hadoop Cluster – Yarn. Fault tolerant – allows node to go down without crashing or restarting job. A distributed processing framework written primarily in the Scala programming language. The framework offers different language APIs on top of the core Scala-based framework. Spark maintains MapReduce’s linear scalability and fault tolerance, but extends it in three important ways: First, rather than relying on a rigid map-then-reduce format, its engine can execute a more general directed acyclic graph of operators. This means that in situations where MapReduce must write out intermediate results to the distributed filesystem, Spark can pass them directly to the next step in the pipeline. Second, it complements its computational capability with a rich set of transformations that enable users to express computation more naturally. Out-of-the-box functions are provided for various tasks, including numerical computation, datetime processing, and string manipulation. Third, Spark extends its predecessors with in-memory processing. This means that future steps that want to deal with the same dataset need not recompute it or reload it from disk. Spark is well-suited for highly iterative algorithms as well as ad hoc queries.
Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system designed for fast processing of large-scale data by performing tasks in-memory, which significantly speeds up computation compared to disk-based systems like Hadoop. Spark is particularly known for its lazy evaluation model, where transformations on data (such as map or filter) are not executed immediately but are only computed when an action (like collect or reduce) is triggered. This allows Spark to optimize the execution plan by minimizing the number of data passes and combining transformations. Unlike traditional systems that rely heavily on disk storage, Spark primarily keeps data in memory, leading to faster processing, though it can spill to disk if memory limits are exceeded. This design makes it highly efficient for iterative machine learning algorithms and interactive data analytics. Overhead using PySpark because of conversation to Java, P4J Python for Java.Difference Between PySpark and Python Terminal. PySpark, session is already active."
Tooling,Definition,Azure Synapse Analytics,"Azure Synapse Analytics provides a single, cloud-scale platform that supports multiple analytical technologies; enabling a consolidated and integrated experience for data engineers, data analysts, data scientists, and other professionals who need to work with data."
Tooling,Definition,FastAPI,"Simplified Framework for creating API and dstributing. You lose some control relative to Flask, however you gain simplicity, do not need to think about and address ever detail."
Tooling,Definition,Pydantic,"Pydantic is a data validation and settings management library in Python, primarily used to validate data against a specific data model (schema) and to parse and serialize complex data types. A ""Pydantic model"" refers to a class definition in Python that inherits from pydantic.BaseModel. These models define the structure of data that you expect to receive or send in your application and allow you to enforce constraints on that data."
Tooling,Definition,Gradio,Open Source Web Based Python Library for customizable web-based user interfaces
Tooling,Definition,Vector Database,"Specialized data storage system designed to store and search high-dimensional vector representations (embeddings) of data such as text, images, audio, or other unstructured content. These vectors are typically produced by machine learning models and capture the semantic meaning or similarity between items, enabling searches based on meaning rather than exact matches. Vector databases became prominent with the rise of deep learning and large language models, which rely on embeddings for tasks like recommendation, semantic search, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Their importance lies in enabling fast similarity searches across millions or billions of vectors, which is essential for modern AI applications. Unlike traditional databases that use exact matches or structured queries (e.g., SQL), vector databases use approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms to find the most similar items based on distance metrics such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance."
Tooling,Definition,LlamaIndex,"Python framework designed to help connect large language models (LLMs) with external data sources such as files, databases, and APIs. It provides tools for ingesting, structuring, indexing, and retrieving data so LLMs can query information beyond their training data. LlamaIndex supports multiple data loaders, indexing strategies, and retrieval methods to enable retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows. It is commonly used to build LLM-powered search, question-answering, and knowledge-assistant applications."
Tooling,Spark,Action,"In Spark, actions trigger the execution of transformations and return a result to the driver. The collect action retrieves all elements of an RDD and brings them to the driver, while count returns the total number of elements in the RDD, and countByValue provides the frequency of each unique element. take retrieves the first N elements, top returns the largest N elements, and reduce applies a specified associative function to aggregate all the elements of the RDD into a single result."
Tooling,Spark,Narrow Transformation,"Each partition of the parent RDD is used by at most one partition of the child RDD. This means that data is not shuffled across the network between partitions, and each transformation can be executed locally on the same node. Examples of narrow transformations include map, filter, and flatMap. Because they don't involve data movement, narrow transformations are more efficient.]"
Tooling,Spark,Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD),"Fundamental data structure in Apache Spark, representing an immutable, distributed collection of objects that can be processed in parallel across a cluster. RDDs provide fault tolerance through lineage, which means they can automatically recompute lost data due to node failures by keeping track of the transformations applied to the original dataset. They support two types of operations: transformations (e.g., map, filter) that define a new RDD from an existing one, and actions (e.g., collect, reduce) that return a result or save it to external storage. RDDs are designed to handle large-scale data processing efficiently, providing users with control over partitioning and persistence in memory or on disk. RDD are Key Value Pairs. They are also the original and simplest from of Data in spark."
Tooling,Spark,SparkConf,"This is used to configure the settings of Spark, such as the master node, application name, etc"
Tooling,Spark,SparkContext,"The entry point to low-level Spark functionalities, including creating and managing RDDs. It provides the connection to the cluster and manages job execution."
Tooling,Spark,Transformations,"In Spark, transformations are operations that create a new RDD from an existing one. The map transformation applies a 1-to-1 function mapping, creating a new RDD where each input element has one corresponding output, while flatMap allows 1-to-X mapping, potentially returning more or fewer elements than the input. Other transformations include filter (selects elements that satisfy a condition), distinct (removes duplicates), sample (extracts a random subset), union (combines two RDDs), intersection (returns common elements between multiple RDDs), subtract (removes elements found in another RDD), and cartesian (produces all combinations of elements from two RDDs)."
Tooling,Spark,Pyspark,"It is the storage layer of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem, designed to store and manage large volumes of data across a distributed cluster of machines. Files are split into blocks (default: 128MB or 256MB).These blocks are distributed across multiple nodes in a cluster.Each block is replicated (default: 3 copies) across different machines. If one node fails, data is still accessible from other nodes.Files in HDFS are typically written once and read many times. Optimized for streaming reads of large files, not quick random access."
Tooling,Spark,SparkSQL,"A Spark module for structured data processing. It is part of the core Spark framework and accessible through all of its language APIs, including PySpark."
Tooling,Hadoop,HDFS,"It is the storage layer of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem, designed to store and manage large volumes of data across a distributed cluster of machines. Files are split into blocks (default: 128MB or 256MB).These blocks are distributed across multiple nodes in a cluster.Each block is replicated (default: 3 copies) across different machines. If one node fails, data is still accessible from other nodes.Files in HDFS are typically written once and read many times. Optimized for streaming reads of large files, not quick random access. Hadoop Distributed File System."
Tooling,Paradigm,Distributed Computing,"A simple way to think about distributed systems is that they are a group of independent computers that appear to the end user as a single computer. They allow for horizontal scaling. That means adding more computers rather than upgrading a single system (vertical scaling). The latter is relatively expensive and often insufficient for large workloads. Distributed systems are great for scaling and reliability but also introduce complexity when it comes to design, construction, and debugging. One should understand this trade-off before opting for such a tool. A great tool when: Data does not fit into RAM, must be partitioned, Increases Cost of Moving Data, Memory Faster than Harddrive, Increased cost and risk of failure."
Validation,Procedure,Confusion Matrix,"Table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model by comparing predicted labels to actual labels. It summarizes the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, providing a detailed view of where the model makes correct and incorrect predictions. This breakdown supports the calculation of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score."
Validation,Procedure,K Fold Cross Validation,"Application of Cross Validation. Method for increasing ability to generlize results by segregating Training Data into K folds, such that the model never predicts on data it has seen. As an example, if Folds = 10 and x=100, each of the iterations would hold out 10 examples (such that all examples were held out in a iteration) and when the data was held out the model would predict. To reiterate, it helps with generalization, it does not increase performance, does not average and does not boost. It does materially increase training time. Primarily useful when data limitation exist, you're early on in development and want to prevent leakage or get cursory results. Also can provide a truer indication of performance based Metrics."
Validation,Procedure,Startified Cross Validation,"Increasing the Principle of Cross Validation and ensuring that the data is split into statistically represented folds, which when data is not IID could be considered valuable to ensure that inference is accurate and representative."

ML Definitions,Definition,Multimodal AI,"Artificial intelligence systems that can process and integrate multiple types of data, such as text, images, audio, and video, to perform tasks"
ML Definitions,Definition,Learning Type,"Describes how the model or technique learns from data, specifically the nature of the labels or feedback it receives during training. It distinguishes whether learning is driven by known outcomes (Supervised), structure discovery without labels (Unsupervised), or performance assessment rather than learning itself (Evaluation). This column anchors where in the ML lifecycle a concept operates."
ML Definitions,Definition,Algorithm Classification ,"Describes the primary task or problem the algorithm is designed to solve, independent of its mathematical form. It answers the question: What kind of output or decision does this algorithm produce? This column is essential for aligning techniques to business or analytical objectives rather than implementation details."
ML Definitions,Definition,Model Type,Captures the structural or mathematical nature of how an algorithm represents relationships in data. It reflects the inductive bias of the model—how it assumes patterns are formed—rather than what task it performs. This column helps explain why models behave differently even when solving the same problem.
ML Definitions,Definition,Embedding,"Numerical vector representation of data—such as words, sentences, images, or users—designed to capture its meaning, features, or relationships in a mathematical form. The concept originates from fields like linear algebra and representation learning, where complex or unstructured data is mapped into a continuous, high-dimensional space. In this space, items with similar meanings or characteristics are located closer together, enabling machines to compare and reason about them using distance or similarity measures. Embeddings are important because they allow machine learning models to work effectively with text, images, and other unstructured data by converting them into a form algorithms can process. They are widely used in applications such as semantic search, recommendation systems, clustering, and large language model pipelines like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)."
ML Definitions,Guiding Principle,XOR,"Logical operation that outputs true when exactly one of its inputs is true, but not both. It originates from Boolean algebra and early digital logic design. XOR is important in machine learning because it represents a classic example of a non-linearly separable problem. This made it historically significant in exposing the limitations of single-layer perceptrons. XOR is widely used in cryptography, digital circuits, and as a teaching example for neural networks and feature interactions."
Behavioural Economics,Definition,Anchoring Effect,"A cognitive bias where people rely too heavily on the first piece of information (the “anchor”) when making decisions. Once an anchor is set, it influences subsequent judgments, even if it’s arbitrary or unrelated. For example, when asked whether the Eiffel Tower is taller or shorter than 500 feet, people’s estimates will cluster around that number. This bias can affect pricing, negotiations, and even forecasting."
Behavioural Economics,Definition,Base Rate Fallacy,"People ignore or undervalue general statistical information (the base rate) and focus instead on specific information, often leading to incorrect conclusions. In decision-making, individuals may give more weight to anecdotal or vivid information, despite the broader statistical reality that should influence their judgment. Imagine a test for a rare disease that is 95% accurate. The disease affects 1 in 10,000 people. If a person tests positive, many might assume the likelihood of them having the disease is high. However, considering the base rate (the rarity of the disease), the probability of actually having the disease is still very low. In this scenario, the base rate fallacy would be ignoring the low prevalence of the disease (the base rate) and overestimating the accuracy of the test result, leading to an exaggerated belief in the likelihood of the person having the disease. The fallacy demonstrates how people's intuitive reasoning often neglects the significance of background statistical data in favor of more attention-grabbing or salient information."
Behavioural Economics,Definition,Beaucratic Politics,"Organization decision making paradign in which decisions are made based solely on who is making the decision, specifically, they will decide in their own best interests. Counters prevelant theory in which a rational, fair or logical decision making process will occur."
Behavioural Economics,Definition,Biased Assimilation,Tendency to interpret information in a way that supports a desired conclusion. 
Behavioural Economics,Definition,Blind spot bias,"Cognitive bias where people are unaware of their own biases, while easily recognizing the biases in others.  People tend to believe they are more objective, rational, and less susceptible to biases than others, even though they may exhibit the same biases in their own thinking. Self-awareness gap: People can easily identify cognitive biases (like confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, or stereotyping) in others, but fail to recognize these biases in themselves. Overconfidence in objectivity: Individuals often overestimate their own ability to reason without bias, which can lead to an inflated sense of confidence in their decisions and beliefs. Resistance to feedback: Blind spot bias can make people resistant to feedback, because they believe that they’re viewing situations or information more objectively than they actually are."
Behavioural Economics,Definition,Confirmation Bias,"Also known as Selective Perception. What people see can be strongly shaped by what they believe, using the example of a study which occurred during a especially dirty Princeton Dartmouth Football game. After the game people were asked to comment which team was ""Dirtier"" and results were based on which team individuals had allegiance with.

Tendency to search for, interpret, and remember information in a way that confirms one’s preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. People often ignore or downplay evidence that contradicts their views. This bias can reinforce stereotypes, polarize opinions, and skew data interpretation. It’s especially important to watch for in research, media consumption, and decision-making."
Behavioural Economics,Definition,Fact Believability,"Facts about this epidemic that have lasted a few days are far more reliable than the latest ‘facts’ that have just come out, which may be erroneous or unrepresentative and thus misleading . . . a question that today can be answered [by] only informed belief may perhaps be answered with a fact tomorrow."

Behavioural Economics,Definition,Truth-default theory ,"54% accurate identifying liar. We can identify truth tellers far more easily, bad at identifying liars. We start in a default position of believing people and only when substantial evidence to the contrary presents itself do we change our position. In fact, we can even trivialize information away that in hindsight it rather pertinent. In a social experiement, teacher leaves room, answers are available, rando we’ve never met encouraging us to cheat."
Behavioural Economics,Definition,Illusion of Asymmetric Insights,"The Belief that we know others better than they know us and that we may have insights about them that they lack (but not vice versa). As explained by the fill in the blanks word game, the words don’t define me, yet they do define others. CIA Officers. Judges. "
Behavioural Economics,Definition,Intertemporal choice, Refers to decisions that involve trade-offs between costs and benefits occurring at different points in time
Behavioural Economics,Definition,Motivated reasoning,"Cognitive phenomenon where people process information in a biased way to support their existing beliefs, desires, or emotions. Instead of evaluating evidence objectively, individuals interpret information in a way that aligns with their preferred conclusions or outcomes. Directional reasoning: When people want to arrive at a specific conclusion, they give more weight to evidence that supports their desired belief and discount or dismiss evidence that contradicts it. Accuracy reasoning: In contrast, this occurs when individuals are genuinely motivated to arrive at a correct or objective conclusion. They carefully analyze all available evidence regardless of whether it supports their initial belief. 
Type of cognitive bias where people process information in a way that aligns with their preexisting beliefs, desires, or emotions, rather than objectively evaluating the facts"
Behavioural Economics,Definition,Naive realism,"Naïve realism is a concept from social psychology and philosophy that describes the human tendency to believe that we see the world objectively, and that other people who disagree must be uninformed, irrational, or biased.  
Naïve realism explains why disagreements can become hostile. We assume others are irrational or malicious instead of recognizing legitimate differences in perspective or interpretation. It makes it harder to understand or appreciate others’ viewpoints, since we believe our view is the only valid one.It contributes to us-vs-them mentalities in politics and culture. Each side thinks it's simply seeing ""facts,"" while the other is deluded.In workplaces or teams, naïve realism can block constructive dialogue and creative problem-solving by dismissing dissenting ideas too quickly."
Behavioural Economics,Definition,Ostrich Effect,"cognitive bias where people avoid information they perceive as potentially unpleasant or negative—like an ostrich metaphorically ""burying its head in the sand"" to avoid danger (even though real ostriches don’t actually do this)."
Behavioural Economics,Definition,Unitended Consequences KPIs,"Must consider what adverse effects one might create when measuring. Doctors won’t operate on sick patients. Data needs to be understood. Maximum day wait for appointment, doctors stopped taking appointments."
Behavioural Economics,Definition,What Meaning Does a KPI actually have?,"Before we figure out whether nurses have had a pay raise, first find out what is meant by “nurse.” 
Before lamenting the prevalence of self-harm in young people, stop to consider whether you know what “self-harm” is supposed to mean. Before concluding that inequality has soared, ask, “Inequality of what?” Demanding a short, sharp answer to the question “Has inequality risen?” is not only unfair, but strangely incurious. If we are curious instead, and ask the right questions, deeper insight is within easy reach.

You should never trust large organizations, on the best day they’re incompetent, on a bad day they’re crooked."
Behavioural Economics,Definition,Think about the Medium,"Weekly, daily, hourly—the metronome of the news clock changes the very nature of what is news. Daily news always seems more informative than rolling news; weekly news is typically more informative than daily news."
Theorem,Definition,Occam's Razor,"Philosophical principle that suggests when faced with multiple explanations for a phenomenon, the simplest one is often the best. It emphasizes minimizing unnecessary assumptions and complexity while ensuring the explanation or solution remains sufficient to address the problem. Simpler models or explanations are easier to understand, communicate, and test, they avoid overfitting, and provides a heuristic for prioritizing hypotheses that require fewer assumptions, allowing for a more structured and efficient approach to problem-solving."
Theorem,Definition,Pareto Principle,"80/20 Rule, is a principle named after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who observed that roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes."
Theorem,Definition,Parkinson's law of triviality,"When a group is asked to make decisions, they often spend the most time on the simplest, least important aspects because these are easier to understand and discuss. For example, in a meeting to approve the budget for a nuclear power plant, more time might be spent discussing the design of a bike shed for employees than on the complex technicalities of the plant itself. This is because everyone understands and feels competent to discuss the bike shed, but few are knowledgeable enough to weigh in on the technical aspects of the power plant. Misallocation of Resources: The law of triviality suggests that important decisions are often overshadowed by trivial ones, leading to a misallocation of attention and resources. Cognitive Bias: People tend to focus on topics they feel more comfortable with, even if those topics are less critical. This can result in ineffective decision-making where the more significant and complex issues are neglected."

Authentication is terrible caching. Don't Cache purchases and refunds. Search Queries, too broad. Can't cache transaction."
Data Engineering,Definition,API Processing,"API processing involves handling requests and responses through an Application Programming Interface to enable system-to-system communication. It emerged alongside service-oriented and later microservices architectures. Its importance lies in enabling modular, scalable, and interoperable systems. API processing is fundamental to modern applications, allowing real-time access to models, databases, and services. In ML systems, APIs are often used to deploy models for inference in production."
Data Engineering,Definition,Batch Processing,"Batch processing refers to executing data processing tasks on large volumes of data all at once, rather than continuously or in real time. It originated in early mainframe computing, where jobs were collected and run during scheduled windows. Its importance lies in efficiency and scalability, making it ideal for heavy computations and historical analysis. Batch processing is commonly used in data warehousing, ETL pipelines, and large-scale machine learning training. It prioritizes throughput over latency."
Data Engineering,Definition,Wrapper,A wrapper is a small piece of code whose only job is to run something else in a controlled way. It doesnt change the code.It does not change your program’s logic. It just sets up the environment and then calls the real program.
Data Engineering,Definition,Shebang,First line of a script that tells the operating system which interpreter should be used to run that file.
Data Engineering,Definition,Latency,"Time delay between a request being made and the corresponding response being received. It originates from telecommunications and systems engineering. Latency is important because it directly impacts user experience, system responsiveness, and real-time decision-making. In data and ML systems, latency constraints often drive architectural choices and model complexity. It is a critical consideration in APIs, streaming systems, and real-time inference pipelines."
Data Engineering,Definition,Service Oriented Architecture,"Software design paradigm where functionality is organized into reusable, loosely coupled services that communicate over standardized interfaces. It emerged in the early 2000s as enterprises sought scalable and interoperable systems. SOA is important because it enables modularity, reuse, and organizational alignment between business capabilities and technical services. It is commonly applied in large enterprise systems, integration platforms, and legacy modernization efforts. SOA often emphasizes governance, shared infrastructure, and centralized control."
Data Engineering,Definition,Microservies Architecture,"Approach that structures applications as a collection of small, independently deployable services focused on a single business capability. It evolved from SOA, driven by cloud computing, DevOps, and scalability demands. Microservices are important because they enable rapid iteration, fault isolation, and independent scaling. They are widely used in modern cloud-native applications and ML platforms where services such as data ingestion, training, and inference are separated. Microservices trade operational simplicity for architectural flexibility."

It extends ideas from DevOps into ML, addressing ML-specific challenges such as data versioning, model drift, reproducibility, and continuous retraining. An MLOps framework defines how models move from experimentation to production, how changes are tracked, and how performance is governed over time. Without MLOps, ML systems tend to break silently, become impossible to reproduce, or drift away from real-world performance."
Model Type,Parameter,Linear Models,"Linear models assume a linear relationship between input features and the target, meaning changes in inputs produce proportional changes in outputs. They represent patterns using weighted sums of features and are valued for interpretability, stability, and computational efficiency. Models belong here only if the core decision function is linear in the parameters, even if the inputs are transformed beforehand."
Model Type,Parameter,Nonlinear Models,"Models which capture relationships that cannot be represented as a straight-line combination of inputs. They allow interactions, thresholds, and curvature to emerge naturally from the model structure rather than explicit feature engineering. A model belongs here if nonlinearity is intrinsic to the learning mechanism, not merely the result of preprocessing."
Model Type,Parameter,Tree-Based Models,"Models which learn decision rules by recursively splitting the feature space into regions based on threshold conditions. They originate from decision theory and are prized for interpretability, handling mixed data types, and capturing nonlinear interactions without feature scaling. A model belongs here if its primary structure is a decision tree, regardless of whether it is used alone or in combination."
Model Type,Parameter,Ensemble Models,"Models which combine multiple base models to produce a single, usually more robust, prediction. The core idea is that diverse models can compensate for one another’s errors, improving generalization and stability. A model belongs here if multiple learners are explicitly trained and aggregated as part of the algorithm."
Model Type,Parameter,Instance Based Models,Models which make predictions by directly comparing new observations to stored training examples rather than learning a global model. They defer learning until inference time and rely heavily on distance or similarity measures. A model belongs here if predictions are driven primarily by local neighborhood relationships.
Model Type,Parameter,Probabilistic Models,"Models which explicitly represent uncertainty by modeling data as random variables governed by probability distributions. They produce likelihoods or posterior probabilities rather than only point estimates. A model belongs here if probability theory is central to its formulation, not merely an output option."
Model Type,Parameter,Neural Models,"Models which learn representations through layers of interconnected units inspired by biological neurons. They are highly expressive and excel at capturing complex, hierarchical patterns in large datasets. A model belongs here if learning occurs via weighted layers optimized through gradient-based training."
Model Type,Parameter,Kernel-based Models,"Models which  implicitly map data into high-dimensional feature spaces to make complex patterns linearly separable. They rely on similarity functions rather than explicit feature construction. A model belongs here if a kernel function is central to learning, not optional."
Model Type,Parameter,Rule-base Models,Models which operate using explicit if–then logical rules that define decision boundaries. These rules may be learned from data or manually specified and prioritize transparency and control over flexibility. A model belongs here if decision logic is expressed directly as interpretable rules.
Model Type,Parameter,Meta Models,"Models which operate on top of other models, either by combining, selecting, calibrating, or learning from their outputs. They do not model raw data directly but instead reason about predictions or model behavior. A model belongs here if its inputs are outputs of other models."
Generative AI,Definition,Prompt Engineering,"The art and science of crafting effective inputs for large language models to generate desired outputs. As language models have evolved in capability and size, so too has the importance of how we communicate with them. Prompt engineering involves strategically designing text prompts that guide an AI model's responses toward specific goals, formats, or reasoning patterns."
Generative AI,Definition,In Context Learning,"represents one of the most fascinating capabilities of modern large language models. It is a model's ability to ""learn"" from examples provided directly within the prompt itself, without any updates to its underlying parameters or weights. This capability allows models to adapt to new tasks or domains simply by demonstrating what success looks like through examples."
Generative AI,Definition,Zero-shot prompting,"Technique where the model performs a task without any examples or prior specific training on that task. This approach tests the model's ability to understand instructions and apply its knowledge to a new context without demonstration. Zero-shot prompts typically include clear instructions about what the model should do, allowing it to leverage its pre-trained knowledge effectively."
Generative AI,Definition,One-shot prompting,"Provides the model with a **single** example of the task before asking it to perform a similar task. This technique gives the model a pattern to follow, improving its understanding of the desired output format and style. One-shot learning is particularly useful when you want to guide the model's response without extensive examples."
Generative AI,Definition,Few-shot prompting," Extends the one-shot approach by providing multiple examples (typically 2-5) before asking the model to perform the task. These examples establish a clearer pattern and context, helping the model better understand the expected output format, style, and reasoning. This technique is particularly effective for complex tasks where a single example might not convey all the nuances.
"
Generative AI,Definition,Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting,"Encourages the model to break down complex problems into step-by-step reasoning before arriving at a final answer. By explicitly showing or requesting intermediate steps, this technique improves the model's problem-solving abilities and reduces errors in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. CoT is particularly effective for mathematical problems, logical reasoning, and complex decision-making tasks.
"
Generative AI,Definition,Self-consistency," Advanced technique in which the model generates multiple independent solutions or answers to the same problem, then evaluates these different approaches to determine the most consistent or reliable result. This method enhances accuracy by leveraging the model's ability to approach problems from different angles and identify the most robust solution through comparison and verification."
Generative AI,Tooling,LangChain,"Framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by language models. Built to address the challenges of working with LLMs in practical settings, LangChain provides a standardized interface for connecting models with various data sources and application environments.

LangChain serves as an abstraction layer, making it easier to build complex LLM applications without handling the low-level details of model interaction. This framework has become a standard tool in the LLM ecosystem, supporting a wide range of use cases from chatbots to document analysis systems.
"
Langchain,Definition,Prompt templates,"Key concept in LangChain. They help translate user input and parameters into instructions for a language model. These templates can be used to guide a model's response, helping it understand the context and generate relevant and coherent language-based outputs.

A prompt template acts as a reusable structure for generating prompts with dynamic values. It allows you to define a consistent format while leaving placeholders for variables that change with each use case. This approach makes prompting more systematic and maintainable, especially when working with complex applications."
Python,Guiding Principle,Python Function Naming Convention,"Pythonic function naming follows the snake_case convention and uses clear, action-oriented VERBS  to describe exactly what the function does. Function names should be explicit, readable, and predictable, prioritizing clarity over brevity. Functions that return values without side effects commonly use get_, while functions that return booleans should begin with is_, has_, or can_ to make intent unambiguous. This convention improves readability, maintainability, and composability in analytical and production codebases. Examples: 
create, get, transform, calculate, "
Python,Guiding Principle,Data Set Column Naming,"Dataset column naming should use ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE and describe what the data represents, not how it was created. Column names should encode semantic meaning, time context, and measurement type so they remain interpretable without reference to code. Unlike functions, column names are noun-driven and stable, serving as part of the dataset’s contract across models, analyses, and stakeholders. Consistent naming supports reproducibility, governance, and correct modeling behavior.
