CSV Generated from this process saved to Github and Used for Streamlit Dashboard.
Approach takes D Notes as the Primary Source and then merges in Definitions, based on a 4 step integration process.
Approach uses some Filtering Logic
Step1:
When Word in Both Sheets is Identical, then utilize word as definition.
If Word Does not have a Definition in the D Notes, then replace blank with the definition.
If word has a definition, then add a new record.
Step2:
Utilzing Function notes_word_equals_word_definition_categorization, integration where notes.word=definitions.categorization
It also begins to replace Word.
Step3:
Utilizing Function notes_word_equals_definition_process, integration where notes.word=definitions.process

final_dataset_for_markdown,"Function which helps to combined Notes and Definitions into a Single Combined Representation which can ultimately be used as a Learning Reference Tools.
How this function Works:
It takes the two sheets and attemps to Consolidate them together to make Final Dataset, generated as d_learning_notes.csv.
Approach is to Take Notes As the Framework and Distribute All Information into the Notes Sequentially in Specific Order so i can
Understand the structure and how to continue and utilize the Sheet.
Principles:
- Define all types of Records in Notes and then Move them Out Definiton By Definition
- Worry about Order at End.
Step 1: Insert Records where Categorization = Definition directly into Sheet.
With Modification:
Where Word is also A Categorization, Update Categorization from Definition to Word, Change Word to Definition,
and Updated Definition to include WORD:
Step 2: Take Everything else. Should be nothing remaining from Notes Category, so need to update Category, by moving all information
to the Right 1 column and consolidating Definition.","['notes', 'definitions', 'export_location']",,,,,,,df_processing.py
