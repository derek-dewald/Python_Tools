    "### ** You Should Standardize If:**\n",
    "**Youâre Using Distance-Based Algorithms**  \n",
    "   - Algorithms that rely on **distance metrics** (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan) perform better when features are standardized.\n",
    "   - Examples:\n",
    "     - $K$-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
    "     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "     - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "     - $K$-Means Clustering\n",
    "     - Linear Regression (if gradient descent is used)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Features Have Different Scales**  \n",
    "   - If some features are on **very different scales**, standardization helps **prevent one feature from dominating the model**.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     - **Feature 1:** Age $(20$ to $80)$\n",
    "     - **Feature 2:** Salary $(20,000$ to $200,000)$\n",
    "   - **Without standardization**, the model might focus too much on salary because it has larger values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Youâre Using Regularization (Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet)**  \n",
    "   - Standardization ensures that **penalty terms** ($L_1, L_2$) are applied **fairly across all features**.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Your Model is Sensitive to Outliers**  \n",
    "   - Standardizing data **reduces the impact of extreme values** by centering around zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ** You Can Skip Standardization If:**\n",
    "**Youâre Using Tree-Based Models**  \n",
    "   - **Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)** **do not require standardization**.\n",
    "   - These models are not affected by feature magnitudes because they split data **based on thresholds, not distance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Features Are Already on Similar Scales**  \n",
    "   - If all features are on similar scales (e.g., all between $0$ and $1$), standardization may not add much value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Youâre Working with Categorical Variables**  \n",
    "   - Standardization applies only to **numerical features**.\n",
    "   - **One-hot encoded variables do not need standardization**."
